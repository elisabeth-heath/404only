                <span class="summary-long" style="display:none;">“Absolutely not,” Merlin said, looking at his husband as if he had two heads, “You’re eight months pregnant Arthur! I’m not going to let you fly to another country regardless of whether I’m with you or not!” Notes For Saja and part of the BBC Merlin Father&#x27;s Mpreg Fest “Absolutely not,” Merlin said, looking at his husband as if he had two heads, “You’re eight months pregnant Arthur! I’m not going to let you fly to another country regardless of whether I’m with you or not!” Arthur huffed and leaned back on the couch, rubbing his large stomach. “It’s your fault I’m like this anyway,” he replied, “And it’s not like we could take a trip after the baby is born, at least not for awhile, and even then we won’t be able to do everything we would have otherwise.” Merlin sighed and sat down next to Arthur, wrapping his arms around him. Arthur shifted on the couch, leaning against Merlin’s chest and closing his eyes. Merlin held him close, pressing a soft kiss into Arthur’s golden hair. The pregnancy had not been an easy one. Merlin&#x27;s magic helped as much as it could in keeping the baby and Arthur healthy, but it worsened the side effects. Merlin always worried for him, though Arthur told him not to. Arthur was strong, yes, but Merlin loved him too much to let anything happen. The rest of the evening passed uneventfully, watching Toy Story again because Arthur wanted to, cuddling on the couch. Merlin helped Arthur up despite his protests that it really wasn&#x27;t necessary and helped him into bed. &quot;You know I love you more than anything,&quot; Merlin whispered into Arthur&#x27;s back, &quot;I won&#x27;t let anything happen to you.&quot; &quot;I love you too,&quot; Arthur replied, &quot;Get some sleep, idiot.&quot; Merlin laughed, &quot;Prat.&quot; Even after Arthur&#x27;s breathing evened out, Merlin lay awake. He knew that Arthur had started feeling trapped by the limitations of pregnancy, but it wasn&#x27;t safe to take him anywhere this far along. When Arthur had first gotten pregnant, he had been unsure about wanting to carry, but after a series of conversations with Merlin, Morgana, Gwen, and Dr. Gaius, he decided he could do it. For the most part he loved it, especially the extent to which he could get Merlin to do things for him. But Merlin could see that there was still that little bit of reluctance, the fear that something will go wrong, the fear it would change everything too much for them to handle. Merlin pulled Arthur closer to him and swore that he would do everything he could to take away the fear. ***** Where was he? Arthur sighed and began pacing, well, waddling around their living room. The past few days Merlin had seemed distracted and distant, and now he was late to their date night that he had suggested. Was there someone else? would he have to do this by himself? Arthur steadied himself against the end of the cough. No, that was ridiculous. This was Merlin, they love each other and it will stay that way. Before he could continue speculating the door flew open and there was Merlin. &quot;What are you wearing?&quot; Arthur exclaimed, staring at his husband, who appeared to be in a pilot&#x27;s uniform, but with a bouree on his head and a lei around his neck. &quot;Mr. Pendragon, welcome!&quot; Merlin said, beaming, &quot;Please come aboard, it&#x27;s time to depart!&quot; Merlin helped him out of their house, where they were greeted by a convertible that definitely did not belong to them. &quot;I rented it,&quot; Merlin explained as he opened the door for Arthur, &quot;And off we go!&quot; As they drove, Arthur studied Merlin, who kept glancing at Arthur, trying to gage his reaction. Finally, they came to a stop in front of the local football stadium where Arthur&#x27;s pick up team plays. Merlin jumped out of the car and rushed to help Arthur. The stadium seemed empty when they entered, but Merlin led him to a seat anyway. Arthur was about to ask what Merlin was doing when a voice brought his attention to the pitch. &quot;Welcome amigo to the amazing perro fight of Madrid!&quot; Gwaine cheered from down below, wearing tights and a ridiculous sparkling jacket, and holding a bright red cloth. &quot;Ehrm... He means toro, like a bull,&quot; Merlin explained, then yelled down at Gwaine, &quot;Stop trying to speak Spanish!&quot; Then the music started to swell, and another figure ran out onto the pitch. It was Percy, wearing all brown and a pair of horns. Gwaine would wave his red cloth, and Percy would run at it, just as if it was a real bull fight. However, Gwaine wasn&#x27;t quick enough, and Percy tackled him to the ground. Both Merlin and Arthur laughed as Percy held up the red cloth in victory. He then jumped over the barrier separating the field from the seats, and ran up to Arthur and Merlin. “Here you go,” Percy said, and with a flourish, gave Arthur a small Spanish flag. “And off we go!” Merlin exclaimed, and led Arthur out of the stadium and back to the car. As they drove again, Arthur turned to Merlin and asked, “What are we doing?” “Travelling,” was the reply, “I know you want to on a big trip, but that’s not advisable this far along, so I decided to bring the destinations to you!” Once again, they came to a stop, but this time it was in front of a park. Instead of a walk, Merlin led him to a carriage and with a nod, they began clopping down the path. Arthur kept an eye out for a clue as to what they were doing here, but none came until they came to a stop. In front of a piñata in the shape of the Eiffel Tower. “I couldn’t find just a statue,” Merlin said, “And you can’t do France without the Eiffel Tower. But don’t worry, we’re not going to break it.” Arthur laughed and walked over to the paper mache landmark, “It’s very realistic,” he commented. “Now wait right there,” Merlin replied, and pulled out a disposable camera, “Can’t visit without a picture to remember it by!” Arthur just laughed harder, and missed the flash that went off. Merlin grabbed his hand, and dragged him down the path a little farther, where they met Gwen. All around her there were papers taped to the trees, threatening to escape with the breeze. “Welcome to the Louvre!” Gwen said, spreading her hands to encompass the pictures around her, “Please, no flash photography, as it can harm the paintings. If you’ll follow me, I’d be happy to give you a tour.” Gwen and Arthur walked around to each of the individual “paintings” and she told him the history and style of both the picture and the work. Merlin stood off to the side and watched smiling as they got into a deep discussion about one of the paintings. He was so lucky to have a partner as amazing as Arthur, and friends like Gwen, who put so much time into helping him do this for Arthur. “Merlin?” Arthur asked, cupping his neck, “Are you alright? You spaced out a little there.” Merlin just beamed back and replied, “Yeah I’m great. Ready for the next stop?” Arthur smiled and waved his little French flag in response. Arm in arm, the two of them went back to the carriage. On the way back to the car, Arthur rested his head on Merlin’s shoulder, absentmindedly twirling the flag in his fingers. “How did you know which paintings I wanted to see?” he asked suddenly, looking up at Merlin, who smiled softly. “I remembered you mentioning some of them,” he replied, “But Gwen picked out the rest.” Arthur squeezed Merlin’s hand. “Thank you,” he said. “We’ll go to the actual museum, I promise,” Merlin replied firmly, “I know this just isn’t the same.” “It was wonderful,” Arthur reassured him. “It’s not over yet!” Merlin reminded him, and helped him into the car, “Two more stops!” They heard their next destination before they saw it. The strains of Opera could be heard from down the street, and the two men just laughed. “Lance?” Arthur asked, and Merlin nodded. “I promise it’s not an opera though,” Merlin reassured him, “After that incident at Barber of Seville I know better.” Arthur looked abomished. “The insistence on silence is very modern! Excuse me for being traditional!” “Getting Gwaine to sneak a cat on stage? That’s traditional?” Merlin replied, shaking his head. “It happened the first performance,” Arthur defended. “Because it was being sabotaged!” Merlin exclaimed, “You could have just said that opera wasn’t really your thing, it really would have been sufficient.” Arthur just huffed as Merlin parked the car on the side of the road. Lance stood nearby with a boombox at his feet. He beamed at the couple as they got out of the car and turned off the music. The three of them walked over to the playground nearby. Arthur looked at the two of them, incredulous. “I know I’m pregnant, but the baby is still inside. You know that, right?” Merlin rolled his eyes as Lance replied, “We’re going on an archeological dig.” ***** “I found an Aphrodite!” Arthur exclaimed happily, holding up the small statue as proof. “Awesome!” Merlin replied happily, “Put him over there, next to my Athena.” Arthur did carefully, and examined their handiwork. They had found five statues of gods, ten pottery pieces, and eight glasses. All they had left was to uncover the village. He examined the remainder of the sandbox, searching for a good spot to continue digging. “I think I found it!” Merlin exclaimed, and motioned for Arthur to come over. Together with their brightly colored plastic shovels, buckets, and sieves, they began to dig in the right-hand corner of the box. Sure enough, they had found the village, complete with little people in their homes. The two of them beamed at each other, proud of all the hard work they had done in the sandbox for the past hour. “Congratulations!” Lance said, smiling, “Arthur, you’ve earned this,” and he handed him a small Italian flag. Together, Merlin and Arthur made their way back to the car, holding hands and laughing. “I can’t believe you arranged us to play in a sandbox,” Arthur laughed, still holding Merlin’s hand as he drove them to their final destination. “I didn’t,” Merlin admitted, smiling slightly, “I just asked Lance to do something Italian. I was expecting food.” “I had a lot of fun,” Arthur replied, “Where to next?” Merlin glanced over quickly and said, “What makes you think I’ll tell you? We’re almost there.” He parked the car by the river and a figure jogged up to open Arthur’s door. “Aloha!” Elyan said, grinning. He was wearing a bright pink Hawaiian shirt with flowers decorating them. He completed the ensemble with cargo shorts, flip flops, and a bucket hat. “Welcome to the exclusive resort!” he welcomed, throwing a lei around Arthur’s neck. He led them towards the water, where he had set up two lounging beach chairs. After helping Arthur into his, Merlin took his own seat, grinning. Around the chairs there were a few inflatable palm trees, a few tiki candles, and in front of the river there were two poles that were supporting a beach scene in between them. Elyan went behind the image and came out with drinks to give to both Arthur and Merlin. Merlin was about to ask Elyan about alcohol, which Arthur couldn’t have while pregnant, but Elyan answered before he even had a chance to ask. “It’s pineapple juice,” he explained, “No alcohol, but it can help with… other things,” and he winked before pulling a remote out of his pocket and pressing a button. Beach music filled the air and they laughed into their juice. “It wouldn’t be Hawaii without dancing,” Elyan said smirking, “I present to you now our favorite luau dancer!” From behind the beach scene came Leon, wearing a grass skirt and a coconut bra, his hair pulled back in a small bun. Merlin and Arthur howled in laughter as Leon seemed to prep himself, back facing them and standing up straighter. He turned around with as much flair as possible, exclaiming “Luau!” as excited as possible. He swayed his hips and waved his arms to the beat of the music. Merlin looked over at Arthur, who was laughing so hard that he was crying. Their eyes met, and they reached out and took each other’s hands. Arthur mouthed “Thank you, I love you,” and Merlin just mouthed “I love you too.” Then they turned their attention back to the show.</span>

                <span class="summary-long" style="display:none;">Merlin is in love with Prince Arthur. The only problem is that Arthur is in love with Guinevere. Arthur is head over heels in love with Merlin but is convinced the warlock is in love with Morgana, so Arthur is dating Guinevere to make them jealous. Merlin and Morgana aren’t in love, they just tend to pretend to make out to hide that they’re practicing magic together in secret Basically a fake dating au where both Merlin and Arthur are idiots (hence the &quot;the love is requited, they&#x27;re just idiots&quot; tag) Notes See the end of the work for notes There was a knock at the door of Arthur’s chambers. “Enter,” Arthur said, not looking up from his reading. Merlin glanced up at the door from where he was grabbing Arthur’s riding clothes. Gwen entered the room, head held high. “Your Highness,” Gwen said. “The Lady Morgana would like to coordinate outfits with you for the upcoming feast tomorrow.” Merlin looked up at Gwen, the blood draining from his face. He would undoubtedly have to help with all the last minute preparations of said feast. Gwen gave him a sympathetic smile. At least they would be working together. “What possessed Morgana to do that?” Arthur asked, putting down his scroll. “What color was she thinking?” “Emerald green, Your Highness,” Gwen said, curtseying. Arthur’s lip curled in disgust. “Of course she chose green,” he muttered. “Alright. Tell Morgana that that is acceptable. Have Merlin help you with the arrangements.” Merlin looked at Gwen, biting back a groan. “Yes, Your Highness,” Gwen replied with a curtsey before leaving the room. Merlin put down Arthur’s riding clothes and followed after her. If Arthur complained, he only had himself to blame. “So what does this all entail?” Merlin asked. “We find Arthur an outfit in emerald that matches Lady Morgana’s dress.” “That would be easier if Arthur wore anything that wasn’t red,” Merlin grumbled. Gwen laughed as they strode down the halls. “Luckily the tailors already know Arthur’s measurements, it won’t be hard to have something made quickly.” “Is anything quick and easy when it comes to Arthur?” Merlin asked, raising an eyebrow. Gwen laughed again, inclining her head towards Merlin. “Good point. He does have some charming features to him, though.” Merlin’s stomach twisted. A sudden annoyance toward Gwen arose in his chest but he quashed it down. He didn’t want to feel ill will towards her, but it still sat there like a curled dragon, waiting to catch him off guard again. Likely that night when sleep eluded him. “Right,” Merlin muttered under his breath, quiet enough that he thought Gwen wouldn’t hear. Gwen tilted her head and studied him before deciding to pretend she hadn’t heard. Gwen and Merlin passed hurried servants with arms full of decorations and cleaning supplies. “We might also have to help prepare for the feast itself. I will, at least, since Morgana already has a dress.” “I can help. It’ll get me away from Arthur for a while and I’ll be of use for something other than target practice.” Gwen gave a small snort of laughter. “Sorry,” she mumbled. “It’s alright, everyone knows how much of a royal prat Arthur is. I would expect nothing less.” Gwen smiled and shook her head before knocking at the tailor’s door. Entering the room, she said, “Prince Arthur needs a formal outfit for the feast tomorrow.” The tailor nodded wearily. “The usual red?” “No, he’ll be coordinating with Lady Morgana. Emerald green.” “I’ll see what I can do,” the tailor said. “Sorry,” Merlin said. The tailor gave Merlin a weak smile, the bags under his eyes weighing down his entire frame with exhaustion. “Is there something wrong?” Gwen asked, resting a hand on the tailor’s arm. “You seem more exhausted and harried than usual.” “The Lady Morgana convinced King Uther to reinstate the servants’ ball, so I’m working overtime to make items for the servants as well.” “I’m sorry,” Gwen said. “What’s the servants’ ball?” Merlin asked. “It’s a celebration for the servants after the regular feasting activities. A ‘thank you’ of sorts for all the hard work the servants do,” Gwen explained. Merlin nodded. “Is it required?” “Not necessarily, but there will be better food than you get otherwise and I’m requiring you to come with me. We’ll coordinate outfits. I’m thinking a nice blue.” Merlin smiled. “Well then I guess you’re in luck because blue’s my favorite color.” “I’m glad, because I embroidered you a cloak, so there’s no backing out now.” Merlin blanched. “A cloak?” Gwen nodded. “It has stars on it, just wait until you see it.” “This feast was announced today, when did you have the time to make me a cloak?” Gwen shrugged. “A girl gets bored, you know. Besides, I thought it would make a nice Yule gift.” “How did you know my measurements?” Gwen smiled, a mischievous twinkle in her eye. “A girl’s got to have her secrets, Merlin.” Merlin backed away slowly with wide eyes. Gwen laughed. “While you were out helping Arthur, I talked to Gaius. He let me into your room to get the measurements.” Merlin nodded despite his unease. What if she had seen his magic book? “Well, let’s leave the tailor to his work, there’s more to be done,” Gwen said. Merlin wordlessly followed her out and back into the bustling halls. “Do you have a dress for the servants’ ball?” Merlin asked. “I do. Lady Morgana gave it to me as a gift. It’s what inspired me to make your cloak.” “I’m flattered you made me a cloak,” Merlin said. “Of course,” Gwen said, hip checking Merlin. “We’re friends, that’s what friends do.” Merlin laughed. “Guess I better learn to sew, then,” he joked. “That’s unnecessary, but you could help me pick wildflowers to put around the castle,” Gwen said. Merlin nodded. “Sure.” “But for now, we have feast preparations and masters to tend to.” They strode down the halls quickly, Gwen rushing to a servant overburdened with boxes, grabbing the other side of the box. “Well, let’s get to work then,” Merlin said to himself, pushing up his sleeves. He lost Gwen in the commotion but he’d find her eventually. The feast, which was in full swing by then, was a boisterous affair. The bubbling anticipation of the servants’ ball was the only thing keeping all the servants awake as the party went on through the night. Morgana was certainly right, in emerald green, she and Arthur were a stunning picture of elegance and rivaled every other person at the party, even the dignitaries from the neighboring kingdom who had decided to descend upon Camelot so suddenly. But Arthur didn’t have eyes for Morgana. He kept looking over at where Merlin and Guinevere stood together, stunning visions in midnight blue, the lights of the candles catching on the gold and silver embroidered stars on their outfits. Merlin studied Arthur out of the corner of his eyes. Arthur’s gaze kept flitting to him and Gwen. He’s probably swooning over Gwen, Merlin thought bitterly as he filled goblets with wine. As the feasting ended, the band struck up a tune and the dancing began. Merlin watched the glittering nobles and their celebration, not able to do anything more than hold a wine pitcher and maybe shuffle his feet. Gwen bumped shoulders with him. “Cheer up, we’ll be dancing ourselves in a few hours.” “The food better be worth it,” Merlin grumbled. “It will be.” Eventually, the feast wound down and the nobles departed. Merlin helped Arthur undress and retire for the night, not bothering to take off his cloak. It was comfortable and smelled faintly of wildflowers. “Good night, Merlin,” Arthur said as Merlin snuffed out the candles. “Good night,” Merlin said, already on his way out the door. “That cloak suits you.” Merlin stopped, hand resting on the door handle. What was he supposed to say? “Thank you,” Merlin said before closing the door and walking away. He followed the groups of servants crackling with nervous excitement. They obviously knew the way. The less he had to think about where he was walking, the more he could ruminate on what Arthur had said. “Merlin,” Gwen said. He stopped walking, looking around. She popped up at his elbow, linking arms with him. “We have to make our grand entrance together.” Merlin nodded and let Gwen lead him through the castle. The servants’ ball wasn’t like the balls and feasts he was used to. It had the same food, cast offs and leftovers from the feast earlier in the evening, and everyone was dressed in their best, but there weren’t silver plates and a professional band, it was wooden trenchers and the cook had brought her harp. “We’re the best dressed here,” Merlin joked. “Of course we are, isn’t that the point?” Gwen and Merlin exchanged a grin. Gwen opened her hand to Merlin. “Shall we?” Merlin took her hand and let her lead him to the dance floor. They danced, Merlin letting Gwen lead, since she knew more about dancing than he did. They swirled through the dance floor much like Arthur and Morgana had earlier but a starry vision. End Notes This first chapter is short, but they&#x27;ll get longer as they go on This was the inspiration for Merlin’s cloak and Gwen’s dress bc why not You can find us at pirates-and-candles and thehotasfuckgay on tumblr.</span>

                <span class="summary-long" style="display:none;">Quite simply, the lyrics of &#x27;The Confrontation&#x27; from Les Misérables rewritten for a scenario in which Arthur finds out about Merlin&#x27;s magic. Notes I&#x27;ve really enjoyed seeing Les Mis at the cinema, and this is my favourite song. Then I told my friend Blackthorn14 (Find her on DA, Tumblr etc!) that someone should rewrite the words for Arthur finding out about Merlin&#x27;s magic. Then I had a go and so did she, and some of her lines were much better than mine, and some of mine she preferred over hers; so I did a bit of cutting and copying and some tweaking here and there, and what you see before you is a more or less equal collaboration. Unfortunately neither of us can sing, but we were pretty pleased with how it turned out, so it seemed a shame not to post it up somewhere... Someone clever Merlin cosplayers need to record this for us. Please, talented people of the internet, do it! For best effect, try singing this along to the track :) We used the film version, though :) [ARTHUR] Merlin, at last, Your secret becomes plain A sorcerer And Camelot’s betrayed [MERLIN] Before you say another word, Arthur Before you send me to the stake to burn Listen to me! There is something you should know. I was working for our destiny. Everything I did I did for you, For Camelot, I fought as best I knew We’re two sides of the same coin. Different sides- [ARTHUR] Merlin, stop it now! I&#x27;ve seen the things magic can do You deserve no trust from me A liar like you. [MERLIN(counterpoint)] Believe of me what you will This is something I had to do You don’t know what I’ve done All I did was save your life You know nothing I have done If not for me you would be dead My magic helped build Albion I am warning you Arthur You still need me by your side There is power in this world That you can’t face alone [ARTHUR(counterpoint)] You have tricked me all these years I considered you a friend No, It was all a lie How many men have I lost? How many fights? Come with me you sorcerer I’ll go on with my father’s deeds Our friendship means nothing now No mercy for scum like you You belong inside a jail All these years you’ve lived a lie You have treated me as a fool How could you keep this from me? I would have kept your secret well If you’d proved that you trust me I’d believe this destiny!</span>

Well... I&#x27;m not a poet, so I have to cope differently. But when, in the face of death, time shrinks dramatically and frail strength doesn&#x27;t allow you to calm the trembling of the arms around you, it&#x27;s better to express too little than nothing. - A collection of loosely connected stories focusing on Arthur and Merlin, intended to deepen the canon. I&#x27;m moving all the stories in &quot;The gold coin&quot; series here! Their updates will appear here. Notes Hello! I&#x27;ve decided to order my &#x27;The gold coin&#x27; series and put all the stories in one place. I will gradually move them here, and their updates, and news will appear here. For those who haven&#x27;t dealt with my work before, I warn you that English isn&#x27;t my strong point, so stupid mistakes may appear. Nevertheless, I hope you&#x27;ll enjoy. Out of love &quot;I believe that this cliché-sounding theory about the power of maternal love should not be underestimated. It may indeed be that Ygraine Pendragon&#x27;s wish for her son to be protected after her death was so powerful that it took human form&quot;. Elanor Wright &quot;The Shadow of the Great King&quot; Out of love Ygraine took off her shoe and touched the pleasantly damp grass with her bare foot. After a moment, she dropped the other one as well and took a few deep breaths. The touch of dew on her skin and the crisp air dampened a little the anxiety that had been tormenting her, which had been growing in her day by day until it had finally begun to overwhelm her to the point where she was unable to function normally. She didn’t mention this to Uther, or even to Gaius. They wouldn&#x27;t understand. They would have thought she was frightened by her pregnancy, that she needs medicine to calm her down. She didn&#x27;t need any medicine. It would only stun her and take away her ability to act, and Ygraine had to do something while she still had time. She knew that the price of her child&#x27;s birth would be her life; not that of some thug, a villain, a random, anonymous person, as Uther wanted to believe, but her own. She grasped this as soon as she felt she was pregnant. A mother&#x27;s life for her son&#x27;s life. It was then that an intrusive voice appeared in her head, a hissing whisper, slipping into her thoughts and poisoning them with its venom. Take some concoction and be done with it. Get rid of this parasite from your body, this monster created against nature that sucks the last breath out of you. She fought a fierce battle with this voice. In her mind, she mercilessly chopped it down with her sword and trampled it into the ground, because she loved her unborn son with her whole being. The strength of this feeling surprised her. She had never been able to imagine motherhood before, and mothers&#x27; declarations that they would do anything for their children sounded to her like just another empty platitude not to be repeated. She wanted to have a child, for her husband, for the kingdom, but not necessarily for her own sake. However, when he appeared under her heart, he unexpectedly warmed her from the inside out, almost melting her insides, it shone like the most precious treasure. And she was going to defend this treasure with all her might. Not for her husband, not for the kingdom, not for herself, but for him, so that he could live, love and be loved as she was now. She talked a lot, sang and played the lute, hoping that her boy... Arthur couldn’t hear that hideous voice. Especially the words about the parasite and the monster. Everyone thought she was in a good mood. Uther looked at her with a tender smile, grasped her hands, showered her with kisses and asked for more songs. She knew a lot of them. She wondered if her son would know them, if he would like them? She looked up into the still dark sky. There was some time left until dawn, maybe an hour. She would have time to return before Uther awoke and became alarmed by her absence. She had gone out into the garden after a particularly awful nightmare in which someone had thrown her newborn into a pit full of snakes, and she could do nothing about it. Unable to move the slightest muscle, she was stuck suspended in space, silent and unnoticed by anyone, like a... ghost. This nightmare was recurring and Ygraine was convinced that there was some symbolism in it, a warning addressed to her. There was also another dream that took her over with particular horror. Three tall, hooded figures, standing over a tank of black water, speaking in one voice about the sentence that had been passed on her son. As they finished speaking, they would dissipate into the mist, and a thunderous laughter, the frantic retching of some powerful being, would reach her. Perhaps it was the same being that tried to plant vile thoughts in her mind, called Arthur a parasite and a monster, wanted to get rid of him before he even came into the world. Today, sitting on a stone bench, in a garden she was never to see again in full bloom, Ygraine decided that she could no longer ignore what appeared to be an extra maternal sense that, since she would not be here to guard Arthur&#x27;s every step, she must provide the best possible protection for him. She had no magical abilities, but Gaius had mentioned that there were types of magic where only the power of intention mattered, that for some spells no special talent and years of practice were needed at all. From the pocket of her cloak, she took out her sigil. She clenched it in her hand, as she always did when she wanted to concentrate. Then she stood barefoot on the dew-wet grass. She didn&#x27;t know any ritual, but her heart told her that she didn&#x27;t need any. She raised her hand with the sigil, to the sky, to the twinkling stars, drew air into her lungs, silenced the whispering angry voice with her imaginary sword, pushed all fears, all unnecessary thoughts out of her mind, leaving only what was her purpose. „May Arthur be safe on his journey”, she said quietly. „May someone appear by his side who will love and guard him, as I love and as I would guard. May he be surrounded by true love and people with the sincerest hearts. May all misfortunes pass him by, and may those that cannot pass him by make him stronger and better. May he be happy and may he bring happiness to the world”. Energy, coming as if from within the earth, surged through her, from her toes to the fingers of her hands clenched into a sigil that was warm and pulsed gently. Ygraine noticed with amazement that a thin trickle of blue light flowed from between her fingers. She was overwhelmed with euphoria. She repeated her words louder, more confidently, more powerfully. The sigil burned, but it didn’t scald her skin. A trickle of light transformed into a flame. Ygraine, fascinated, brought it to her face. It was so beautiful that it hurt. She didn&#x27;t want it to disappear. This time she whispered her words directly to it, softly, as if in the ear of a loved one. Tears of happiness ran down her cheeks. The flame turned into a huge ball, which remained on her hand for a moment longer, before rising above the treetops and sailing slowly through the darkness, in a direction it only knew. When it had become barely a tiny dot, Ygraine sank back onto the bench. She was still clutching the sigil, not wanting to part with it. She had no idea what she had just done, but she felt with every, tiniest nerve that something great had happened. She had made it happen: Ygraine, Arthur&#x27;s mother. The voice can whisper to itself, maybe even roar with laughter. She is more powerful. She applied the sigil to her rounded belly. A mother&#x27;s life, for her son&#x27;s life. Arthur will be blood from her blood, bone from her bone, soul from her soul. He will be special. The thought of parting with her life evoked a nauseating fear, , , but Ygraine would probably have chosen to do so even in full knowledge of the price. Or maybe she was fully aware of the price from the beginning? Perhaps she had made the decision herself in her heart? The kingdom needs an heir to the throne, and just as men sacrifice themselves on the battlefields, so too must she not shirk her duty. She put the sigil in her pocket and set off towards the castle. It must be ensured that Arthur gets it. Later today she will talk with Gaius, who, after all, as a physician, is aware that anything can happen during childbirth and will not be surprised by the request. She wasn&#x27;t going to sully Uther&#x27;s happiness, since these were to be their last months together. She would make the most of this time, give him as much as she could, and then... And then he would have a son. Four years later, when, thanks to Uther, things were happening in Camelot that Ygraine had never dreamt of in her worst nightmares, in a small village in a neighbouring kingdom, a midwife handed a tiny boy to a woman exhausted by childbirth. „It would be better for you if that bastard didn&#x27;t start breathing”, she said, looking at her with undisguised contempt. „His name is Merlin”, the young mother replied. „And don&#x27;t you dare call him anything else”. It was supposed to be proof Chapter Summary Merlin has a rather unpleasant morning and then gets a strange command. Set immediately after the end of the season 2.</span>

                <span class="summary-long" style="display:none;">Arthur and Merlin wake Gaius. They&#x27;re absolutely terrible liars. The homophobia is mostly implied, nothing outright. &quot;Merlin?&quot; Arthur hissed out, as he leaned into a crevice in the wall. &quot;Arthur! Finally.&quot; The dark haired boy popped out from his hiding place, bringing a relieved sigh from Arthur. &quot;I was held up. My father.&quot; Merlin nodded in understanding and the two slipped into the dark. Minutes later Merlin was pressed back against the stone wall, hips held down by Arthur&#x27;s hand. The blonde boy nipped gently at Merlin&#x27;s neck, murmuring into his ear. &quot;Missed you.&quot; Merlin sighed into the touch of Arthur&#x27;s lips, and the blonde brought his head up, bringing his lips to Merlin&#x27;s. The two pressed together, Merlin tugging his lover close. Several minutes later, the two broke apart, chests heaving and lips swollen. Merlin grinned up at Arthur, who returned the look. Arthur took Merlin by the hand and the two slipped quietly up to Merlin&#x27;s room. As soon as the door shut Arthur was pulling Merlin close again, seeking any touch. The blonde pushed Merlin back slightly, falling onto the bed. Merlin laughed, then clapped a hand over his mouth, his eyes twinkling. Arthur snorted, but the two quickly became involved in each other&#x27;s touch once again. Arthur lay on top of Merlin, cradling the dark haired boy&#x27;s face in his hand, and kissing the life out of him. Merlin wrapped his arms around Arthur, pulling him closer. Arthur slid one hand away from Merlin&#x27;s face, and slowly slid it under the fabric of Merlin&#x27;s shirt, his hand resting on Merlin&#x27;s stomach, a gentle warmth. Arthur&#x27;s lips traveled down Merlin&#x27;s neck, the smaller boy moaning quietly and the sensation. Arthur rested his other hand on Merlin&#x27;s chest, and then whispered out a rough, &quot;Off.&quot; Merlin sat up, tugging the shirt over his shoulders, before laying back down, a blush spreading down his neck to his chest. Arthur smirked at him, then re-connected their lips briefly, his mouth traveling slowly across Merlin&#x27;s torso, teasing his nipples gently, slowly, before traveling down further. He teased Merlin a bit, tracing patterns across Merlin&#x27;s stomach, knowing he was ticklish. &quot;Arthur!&quot; Merlin hissed, his stomach tensing in protest. Merlin shoved at Arthur&#x27;s head lightly, teasingly, but Arthur got off Merlin entirely. &quot;Oh, you want me off then?&quot; He smirked, and Merlin groaned. &quot;No, I don&#x27;t.&quot; &quot;You sure? You really seemed like you didn&#x27;t there.&quot; His tone was teasing, and Merlin replied with, &quot;I don&#x27;t want you tickling me, but I want you...there...&quot; &quot;Where?&quot; &quot;/There/. Arthur, you know what I mean!&quot; &quot;I wanna hear you say it.&quot; Arthur said, murmuring into his ear, as he lowered his body back down onto Merlin&#x27;s. Merlin rolled his eyes, but muttered out, &quot;I want you on my cock.&quot; Arthur laughed, low in his throat. &quot;Perfect.&quot; The blonde slid back down to Merlin&#x27;s stomach, and after pressing a kiss to his belly button and getting a threatening glare from Merlin he went lower. Arthur grabbed at Merlin&#x27;s trousers, sliding them off his legs. His head went down, and Merlin&#x27;s back arched. ------- Sometime later Arthur lay on Merlins chest, both boys sweaty, their bare skin rosy from their activities. They lay in silence, snuggled into each other, their legs entwined, candlelight flickering on them. Merlin slid his hand onto Arthur&#x27;s cheek, tilting the blonde&#x27;s head so their eyes met. &quot;Hmm?&quot; Arthur mumbled sleepily. &quot;I love you.&quot; Arthur smiled, his eyes close to shutting. &quot;Love you too Mer.&quot; Suddenly, the door opened, showing the shocked face of Gaius. &quot;Excuse me?!&quot; The two jumped, Merlin trying to stutter out an excuse. &quot;Um, uh, I was jus- I mean, we were just-&quot; Arthur interuppted. &quot;We were just hot.&quot; Merlin glared at him when Gaius glanced away, to which Arthur raised his eyebrows, with an expression saying, &#x27;what else could I say.&#x27; &quot;You were hot then.&quot; Gaius said, clearly unbelieving, &quot;Why were you here in the first place then your Majesty? In Merlin&#x27;s bed of all places.&quot; &quot;Well, um,&quot; Now it was Arthur&#x27;s turn to sputter. &quot;He had a disagreement with his father, and needed some place to cool off. We got tired.&quot; Merlin offered. Gaius raised an eyebrow, and then sighed. &quot;I&#x27;m sure you could return to your room without confrontation from your father now my lord.&quot; &quot;Certainly.&quot; Arthur glanced at the door, knowing he was still undressed. &quot;I&#x27;ll leave in a moment.&quot; Arthur nodded at Gaius, who sighed and left the room, but not before giving Merlin a Look. As soon as the door shut, Arthur scrambled for his clothes, as did Merlin. &quot;Hey,&quot; Arthur said, catching sight of Merlin&#x27;s fearful face. &quot;We&#x27;ll be okay. I can see to that.&quot; Merlin nodded, and Arthur brushed his cheek softly with his hand, then leaned in for a quick, very quick kiss. The two went downstairs, and after bidding Gaius goodnight, Arthur was on his way. Merlin avoided the old man&#x27;s eyes, and tried to walk quietly to his room, but Gaius stopped him. &quot;So. Are you going to explain?&quot; &quot;I thought we already had.&quot; Gaius sighed, and sat down. &quot;Merlin. I&#x27;m not stupid. Besides the fact that both of your clothes were strewn about the floor and your bodies are both strewn with kissbruises, you are both terrible, terrible, liars.&quot; Merlin let out a gust of air, and sat down, his face in his hand. After a moment he raised his head, meeting Gaius&#x27;s eyes. &quot;I&#x27;m sorry.&quot; &quot;Do you love him?&quot; &quot;What?&quot; &quot;I asked you if you love him. Do you?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; Merlin whispered, eyes on the floor now. &quot;And he you?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;How long?&quot; &quot;Less than a year. Eight months, in two weeks.&quot; &quot;Well. Invite him here tommorow, I just talk with him.&quot; Merlin looked up, wary. &quot;Why?&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m your guardian, I have to approve of him. He may be the kings son, but that doesn&#x27;t mean he gets to hurt my ward.&quot; Gaius looked down at Merlin kindly, whose face clearly showed his shock. &quot;You aren&#x27;t going to kick me out? Or report us?&quot; &quot;No, I&#x27;m not Merlin. I care for you, if Arthur is who makes you happy then so be it. Doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m going to go easy on him tommorow though.&quot; He said with a wink. &quot;Thank you.&quot; Merlin said, still somewhat dazed. &quot;Of course.&quot;</span>
