He has a decision to make, but fate has other plans and decides his future for him. Notes Disclaimer: Merlin characters are the property of Shine and BBC. No profit is being made, and no copyright infringement is intended. See the end of the work for more notes Merlin looked out over the vast lands that surrounded Ealdor as he sat in the tree he and Will had played in for hours each day as children. It was amazing how much smaller everything appeared now. As a child, the caves and woods had seemed vast and foreboding. Now they merely added charm to the small village Merlin didn’t get to see nearly enough these days. “Where’s Your Royal Pain-in-the-Arse-ness ?” Will asked as he climbed up and sat on the large branch across from Merlin. “I thought loverboy was in a hurry to set off for Camelot this morning, because, well,”— Will was silent for several seconds as he seemed to study Merlin, no doubt thinking of the best snide remark he could—“I guess our sleeping accommodations are lacking and he can’t wait to get back to his royal bedding?” Will gave Merlin his patent exasperated-at-Arthur look that he had perfected over the past several years. “How you can put up with him I’ll never understand; he is the complete opposite of you in every way, Merlin. He doesn’t deserve you.” And you think you do, do you? , Merlin was tempted to say, but he would never hurt Will like that. He instead rolled his eyes. Jealousy really didn’t look good on his friend; one would think that by now Will would have grown up and caught on to the fact that his constant ribbing of Arthur upset Merlin. Then again, Will had never been one to be overly worried about hurting anyone’s feelings; he was one of those people who said what he thought, regardless of the consequences, which had resulted in him getting in more than his fair share of altercations over the years. “You know very well that we have been coming here for the past five years, Will, and Arthur has yet to complain once about sleeping on the floor. It just so happens that he and Mum are taking a walk in the garden. They shooed me off, so here I am.” Merlin schooled his face but was fairly certain the hurt in his voice meant his facial expression was meaningless. Arthur was right: Merlin was as good at hiding his emotions as he was with hiding his magic. “Ah,” was Will’s only response, but he was grinning in that infuriating way of his that meant he was about to wax poetic about some subject or another that Merlin wasn’t going to like. Not wishing to hear Will’s philosophical meanderings, Merlin looked to his left and wondered what his mum and Arthur were talking about. He was curious as to why his mum hadn’t wanted him to hear what she and Arthur had to discuss, but, regardless of the reason, he knew he’d be able to get it out of Arthur. Merlin’s frown turned into a satisfied grin. He had his ways, and what fun ways they were. The thought made him let out a chuckle as he turned back towards Will, who was looking at him strangely, smirking and shaking his head condescendingly. It made Merlin extremely self- conscious and served to turn his grin back into a frown. He didn’t like the look Will was giving him; often times it meant he was about to be teased. “What?” Merlin finally asked, both not wanting yet wanting to know. “You really don’t have a clue, do you?” Will said, letting out a laugh as Merlin continued to stare at him, confused. “Think about it, Merlin. Why would Arthur want to talk to your mother alone , without you present? It is obvious to me,” he added, an exaggerated sigh following. Merlin was tired of this game and wished Will would get on with it and explain himself. “I do not presume to know the ways of Arthur, Will. You know just as well as me that he does as he pleases. He’s a right prat for it, but it’s just how it is, yeah?” Merlin had long ago given up the idea that Arthur would change his ways, and over the past year Merlin had discovered that he really didn’t want Arthur to change at all—he liked Arthur just the way he was. And, it would appear that Arthur felt the same about Merlin seeing as how for the past two fortnights the two had shared Arthur’s bed. “Since you so obviously know what they are talking about, do enlighten me, o wise one ,” Merlin said cheekily. Will rolled his eyes again and sighed in an over-dramatic fashion as he jumped out of the tree and landed on his bum. He looked up at Merlin with a sheepish grin as he swept the wet grass, dirt, and refuse from some animal off of his clothing. “He&#x27;s asking your mum for her permission to take you on as his consort, or whatever you call it whenever a prince prat takes on a lover.” Merlin sputtered. And just how had Will come to that conclusion? Of all the silly things his best friend had ever uttered, this had to be the silliest. Merlin opened his mouth to spout off the reasons Will was wrong. Arthur and he had discussed their situation and had decided that it was best if they kept their relationship quiet for now. Arthur’s father was expecting his son to marry and produce an heir. It would be shock enough for the king to realise his wishes weren’t to be honoured. News of his son taking on a consort, one who happened to be Merlin , would probably be one surprise too many and, as much as Arthur did want to someday be king, he was in no way near ready to do so anytime soon. “That’s just foolish talk, Will. It’s only been two fortnights. I hardly think that constitutes talk of a consortship or whatever you call it,” he said, flustered at the mere idea, and when Will waggled his eyes, Merlin pulled at a small tree limb and threw it at Will, who stuck out his tongue when it sailed past him. “Call it whatever you will, Merlin. He’s mad for you and wants to make sure no one else can get their hands on what is now his.” With that Will walked off, looking somewhat hurt. Frustrated at what Will had said about Arthur not wanting anyone else to get their hands on what was his, and sad about the fact that Will wasn’t talking about just anyone when he’d made that statement, Merlin deliberately turned his head and watched as one of his mother’s neighbors began hanging their laundry to dry. Why did Merlin’s life have to be so complicated? Sometimes he wished he hadn’t left Ealdor. Yes, it took an enormous amount of work each day to survive in the small, rural village, but the work he’d done as a boy had made him feel needed and wanted, and everyone had appreciated him for his willingness to be a help to whoever needed it. In Camelot, Merlin had never quite fit in. Yes, there was Gaius, Gwen, Morgana, and Arthur, and they’d made life bearable for Merlin, but it wasn’t the same. He had left Ealdor because his mother had feared the inevitable rebuke of her son because of his magic, yet she had sent him into the heart of the den of discontent as far as he was concerned. It was truly ironic and infinitely disheartening. Had he remained in Ealdor, he and Will would have no doubt become more than best friends. Not that Will had ever been what Merlin wanted or was looking for in a life partner, but he was Will, and that would have been more than enough. Merlin had always loved him, and that would never change. Will was a good man and worked hard for all he had. And he was wholly devoted to Merlin and thought he hung the moon. And that is why it hurt Merlin so much to see Will walking away, his shoulders slumped. He deserved so much more than what life had given him. Perhaps he really did deserve Merlin more than Arthur did. Not that Merlin wanted to believe that, but it was something to think about. “Merlin, why haven’t you readied the horses? We need to leave,” called out Arthur’s familiar entitled voice, interrupting Merlin’s reverie. Merlin turned towards the sound. How was it that he was falling in love with the prat prince who was technically his employer when he had a sure thing with Will? “Coming,” he sing-songed, thinking that he had some serious thinking to do. A Year Later Merlin sat in his favorite tree in Camelot, breathing heavily, his anxiety threatening to overwhelm him. Arthur would be coming for him soon to tell him how the talk with his father had gone. Arthur had woken up that morning, his legs and arms entangled with Merlin’s, and he had blurted out that today was the day he was going to tell his father that he would never be marrying a princess from some neighboring kingdom because he was in love with Merlin and that he had every intention of spending the rest of his life with him. Merlin had felt such love then and had been hopeful, but now, using magic to strip the bark from one of the branches, all of Merlin’s insecurities returned, full force. He loved Arthur and couldn’t imagine a future without him, but there would be dissention from the nobles regarding him, which he wasn’t at all looking forward to, and then there was that never-ending lump in his throat where Will was concerned. Arthur’s time was becoming less his own with his increased duties because Uther’s health wasn’t good, and that meant his time with Merlin was limited. He was already spending less time with Merlin, and often when they were together Arthur was gruff and and not at all sympathetic when Merlin had grievances. And all of that would only get worse. Yes, Merlin had known that would be the case, but he had overlooked it at the time because he had been so completely besotted with Arthur. Not that Merlin needed to be the center of attention—he very much disliked it when he was the focus of anyone other than his mother, Arthur, or Will, in fact—yet he did crave some little bit of attention. Arthur hadn’t given him that recently. Will would give him that and more. Perhaps Merlin needed to rethink his future. “There you are,” said a voice that grated on Merlin’s nerves. He turned and saw George approaching the tree. “Here I am,” he said flippantly, wondering why he couldn’t be left in peace. “I thought you were gone.” Merlin sighed. He knew it was ridiculous —his dislike of George, but he couldn’t help it. “So why are you looking for me?” he asked, much too petulantly. “I have a letter for you and was told to deliver it to you immediately upon my return to Camelot.” Merlin jumped out of the tree, only thinking after the fact that using magic to cushion his ungraceful landing probably hadn’t been the wisest course of action, but he would worry about that later. He grabbed the parchment from George’s hand and opened it, not caring that George was still there, undoubtedly curious as to its contents. Merlin, I am sorry to have to write you this in a letter, but there has been an accident. Will fell out of your tree this morning and is in a bad way. Please come home if at all possible. I know you and he have had a tense relationship over these past months, but you are his best friend and I know he would want to see you and that you would want to see him. Love, Your Mother Merlin shook his head. Not Will. No, not Will. He wiped at his eyes to rid himself of the onslaught of tears that were threatening to burst free, looked briefly at George, who was studying him a bit too closely, then ran towards the castle to find Arthur and tell him what had happened. There was no way Merlin wasn’t going to Ealdor. There was a delegation from Mercia arriving the following day and Merlin’s schedule had already been booked solid from dawn to dusk, but none of that mattered now. Yes, Arthur would pitch a royal hissy fit and he would want to beg Merlin to not go (Merlin knew he wouldn’t), but there was nothing to be done for it. This was Will. He needed his best friend, and Merlin was not about to let him down. Merlin ran around to all the usual places Arthur would be at this time of day, but, unfortunately, it seemed Arthur was still meeting with his father… which was another tenuous situation. Merlin had been nervous enough about that meeting before, but now, with news of Will’s accident, he was a bundle of nerves. What would the king think if Merlin left now? Merlin swallowed and followed it with a deep breath. It would be the worst possible time to leave. Several minutes later, Merlin, past the point of panic, settled on the floor beside Arthur’s bed and closed his eyes, trying unsuccessfully to calm himself. He needed to go inform Gaius of what had happened, and he needed to procure George’s services for the next several days, but at the moment he could do neither. He leant his head against the bed and allowed the tears to fall. If Will died, Merlin wasn’t sure he could go on. Well, of course, he would, but Will and he were like bread and butter, weren’t they? One could get on without the other but was infinitely improved when the other was added. Perhaps it was not near the same as two sides of the same coin, but not many things were, were they? Merlin was pulled from his depressing thoughts when someone gently touched his face and wiped away a tear. His immediate reaction was to back away, but then he realised it could only be one person; who else would be in this room? Merlin took a shaky breath and tried to pull himself together. He slowly looked up and saw that Arthur was worried. Merlin wasn’t sure he could speak. “What’s wrong? George told me something had upset you.” Arthur sat beside Merlin and pulled him into his lap. It was somewhat awkward, but at the moment Merlin cared little about that. He needed contact with the man he loved, so he gladly relished the feeling of being safe in Arthur’s arms as he rested his head against Arthur’s chest and stared at the wall. “Will has been in an accident. My mum sent word and requested for me to come home to see him. It must be bad.” He felt as Arthur began to run a hand through his hair, and it did wonders for Merlin’s nerves. He closed his eyes. “I know it isn’t a good time, but I must go, Arthur.” And with that Merlin forced himself to sit up and look into Arthur’s eyes. “I need to do this.” A new set of tears made their way down his cheek, and a sob broke forth as Arthur kissed several of them away. “Of course you do. I would be disappointed if you didn’t go,” Arthur said as he wiped away more tears. “You should go as soon as possible. I will have George ready your horse and get your supplies together.” Merlin nodded, but he made no move to stand. He wanted to remain in Arthur’s arms where he felt protected from the outside world. When Arthur leant in and kissed him softly on the lips, Merlin returned the kiss and tried to let the moment warm him. It didn’t, but it did give him strength. “Go to him, Merlin,” Arthur whispered in his ear. Merlin pulled back and nodded before he stood, thanking whomever he should that Arthur understood. “I’ll send word as soon as I know anything,” he said, his voice now much stronger. ~*~ Merlin stood at the door and watched as Will struggled for his every breath. He looked pale. He appeared dead. The person in the bed little resembled the Will who had been Merlin’s best friend ever since the two had been born. According to his mother, Will had climbed the tree and was settling onto his branch when a strong gust of wind had come up, thrown his balance off, and caused him to fall off backwards onto the wood pile beneath. He had been able to yell for help but had lost consciousness soon after, only coming around later that day, and going in and out of awareness since. Slowly, Merlin walked to the bed and sat in the chair. Will looked to be sleeping, but according to his mother, he was probably awake. Merlin opened his mouth but immediately knew he wouldn’t be able to speak. The lump in his throat was huge, even bigger than it had been when he’d thought Arthur had died because of the Questing Beast, and Merlin tried valiantly to keep the emotion away. He didn’t want Will to know how bad off he was. He probably knew—he was the one injured, of course—but Merlin wanted Will to fight this with every bit of fight he had. “Merlin,” Will whispered, slowly opening his eyes. “You came.” His eyes closed again. “Wasn’t sure you would. Thought that prat of yours would have you bowing to his boots or some rot like that.” He then let out a laugh, but the coughing fit that followed was a high price to be paid. Merlin swallowed. He could do this. “As if he could keep me from coming to see you. But, if you must know, Will, Arthur told me to come. Can you believe that?” Merlin let out a weak laugh, for Will’s sake, to keep things light, but laughter was the very last thing he felt like doing. Will again opened his eyes, but it was evident that it was a struggle to keep them as such. “Must know he’s finally won; nothing to worry about now, eh?” A smile, but no laugh this time. “The better man won,” he whispered. He closed his eyes and, soon after, his breathing evened out. Merlin sat there for several minutes, watching as Will slept. Did Will truly believe that? Did he believe Arthur was the better man? Because, if he did, Merlin needed to set him straight. Arthur was not the better man. Yes, he was the man Merlin loved and the one who Merlin wanted to spend the rest of his life with, but he was not the better man. There was no better man in this scenario. There never had been. Merlin looked behind him when he heard someone entering. His mum was watching him sadly. “He isn’t going to survive this, is he?” he asked, dreading the answer, even as he already knew what she’d say. It was evident, and it was nothing less than devastating for him. When he was five, one of his and Will’s friends had died. Merlin remembered being sad and asking why Thomas couldn’t come out and play anymore, but he had been too young to fully grasp what that loss meant. All these years later, he was all too aware, and he wasn’t ready. He would never be prepared for that level of loss. Merlin’s magic could, perhaps, help somewhat, but, as his mother had reminded him, Will was probably too badly hurt—the fall had most likely broken his back. Will was unable to move his legs, and his arm movements were awkward and excruciating to watch. How would Merlin explain if suddenly Will were able to walk? Merlin hadn’t cared and wanted to do whatever it took, but his mother told him that it was likely his magic would merely prolong Will’s suffering, and that was the last thing Merlin wanted to do. He still could have tried and maybe he still could do something, but for better or for worse, he would defer to his mother’s pleadings that he leave things be. It was the hardest decision of Merlin’s life. “No, cariad, I’m sorry to say that his injuries are too severe. I am amazed he has made it this long, but I’m convinced he held on so he could see you again,” his mother said sadly as she joined him and placed her hands on his shoulders. “He loved you so, Merlin.” Merlin turned and looked up at her, seeing the sorrow in her eyes. He wished she hadn’t said that. He knew it was the truth, but it hurt too much to hear now, especially from his mother. “I hurt him, Mum. I didn’t mean to, but I did.” “Will knows that you didn’t want to hurt him, Merlin. He knew that Arthur was the one for you. He knew that the first time he met Arthur, but that doesn’t mean it didn’t hurt him to see Arthur here with you. I think that was what was so hard for him the last time the two of you were here together. He, unlike you, understood why Arthur was here.” Merlin returned his attention to Will. “I didn’t know that is why Arthur had come with me. I don’t know how Will saw it and I didn’t.” It wasn’t exactly the truth, but Merlin didn’t like admitting that he just wasn’t as observant as others. His mother let out a small laugh. “Oh, Merlin, Will was forever seeing things that you didn’t, love. He’s always watched out for you. Of course he would have seen your and Arthur’s trip for what it was. He realised that Arthur wanted you to be in his life forever.” “Did he hate me, Mum?” Merlin asked as he once again looked back at his mother, wanting her to tell him no, but needing to know the truth, regardless of what that was. His mother reached down and wiped a tear from her son’s eye. “Do you honestly think Will could ever hate you, Merlin? That boy was and is completely devoted to you. He did love you, even knowing you could never return his feelings. I’m not going to say he was okay with that—it hurt him deeply, but he told me he would rather have you in his life as a friend than not have you in his life at all.” Merlin found Will’s hand beneath the covers and twined their fingers together. For several seconds he looked at their hands joined, not wanting to believe that soon he would never be able to do this again. He had taken his friendship with Will for granted. Now it was to be taken away. It was so vastly unfair. “I love you, Will. I really do. I could never give you what you wanted, but I have always loved you. Please know that until I breathe my last you will always be my first love. No one can ever take that from us.” Merlin took comfort in the slight squeeze his mother gave his shoulders. He took a deep breath then leant down and kissed Will on the lips that were pale and dry. Merlin’s tears continued to fall and moisten them as he cried for all that he was about to lose. ~*~ “I’m sorry, Merlin,” Arthur said as Merlin crawled into the bed and settled within Arthur’s open arms “I’m so very sorry.” Merlin nodded as he watched his tears fall onto Arthur’s bare chest. He couldn’t speak, but he knew Arthur wouldn’t expect him to. He felt as fingers carded through his hair and as a kiss was placed on his head. “I love you, Merlin.” Merlin was still unable to speak, but he thought it was important for him to look at Arthur before he said what he needed to say. He wiped his eyes and forced himself to look up. He managed a small grin. “And I love you, too, Arthur. I always have.” End Notes Written for the Kill Will Fest on Live Journal I’m sorry, Will. Really, I am; it is all down to the mods that I had to kill you. Speaking of the mods, I want to thank them for coming up with this fest (Most of us really do like Will, yet we seem to kill him off quite often in fic, so it makes sense to make a fest for that).

Merlin groaned, turning to try and bury himself deeper in the nice, warm covers of his bed. He had only gotten a few hours of sleep, spending nearly all of last night explaining to Arthur what Pringles were. &quot;Merlin, I&#x27;m serious! Get out here.&quot; &quot;I swear to God,&quot; the warlock groaned, pulling himself from his bed. &quot;I&#x27;m going to murder you if this is about the toaster again.&quot; &quot;It is not.&quot; Arthur replied from the kitchen. The source of his words were not comforting to Merlin. &quot;Besides, you wouldn&#x27;t kill me anyway. Not when you just got me back.&quot; As Merlin turned the corner into the kitchen, he could see that the blonde hand his hands on his hips and a smug grin on his face. &quot;I think I preferred when you were dead.&quot; He deadpanned, dragging a hand through his sleep- rumpled hair. &quot;What do you need?&quot; &quot;No you didn&#x27;t, you missed me.&quot; Arthur&#x27;s singsong voice carried through the house, grating on the raven-haired man&#x27;s nerves. &quot;I think I may have burned this.&quot; Merlin glanced over to the pot that the King had gestured to. Inside was tomato soup, that was indeed, very, very burnt. &quot;Well, that&#x27;s what you get for trying to cook without me.&quot; &quot;Hey! I was trying.&quot; &quot;Are you pouting?&quot; &quot;King&#x27;s don&#x27;t pout.&quot; &quot;You&#x27;re not King anymore.&quot; Merlin pointed out, a smirk crossing his face as Arthur&#x27;s pout deepened. &quot;According to you, I am the Once and Future King, so yes, I am.&quot; &quot;You&#x27;ll be King again once we get your kingdom back, so,&quot; Merlin walked over to the stove, gingerly picking up the pot and carrying it over to the sink to soak. &quot;Until then, you&#x27;re a normal person.&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m practically a peasant.&quot; The blonde groaned. &quot;Indeed!&quot; Merlin grinned brightly. &quot;Which means you have to actually learn how to do normal things.&quot; &quot;Why can&#x27;t you just do it?&quot; Arthur whined pathetically, plopping down in a kitchen chair with little grace. &quot;I already tried and failed.&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m not your manservant anymore, Sire.&quot; mocked Merlin. Arthur scowled, &quot;you wouldn&#x27;t even have to do anything, just wave your hand and do your,&quot; he gestured wildly with his hands, &quot;thing.&quot; &quot;My thing?&quot; &quot;Your... magic thing.&quot; Arthur bit out. Merlin frowned. He had wished that his King would be more comfortable with his magic. &#x27;But,&#x27; Merlin thought to himself, &#x27; he&#x27;s hardly had any time to truly get used to it, as well as adjust to a entirely new world. &#x27; Merlin sighed to himself, knowing that he just had to give Arthur time. &quot;Well, magic isn&#x27;t really a thing around here, so I can&#x27;t constantly do it. Which means, you need to learn to fend for yourself every once in a while.&quot; Merlin smirked at Arthur&#x27;s downtrodden face. &quot;It won&#x27;t kill you, ya know.&quot; &quot;Ugh, death.&quot; Arthur groaned, leaning forward to lay his head on the cool wood of the kitchen table. &quot;I&#x27;m tired of death.&quot; Merlin swallowed thickly, a lump forming in his throat. He took a deep breath before asking the question that had been on his mind for more than a millennia. &quot;What was it like?&quot; &quot;What was what like?&quot; Arthur asked, his voice muffled by the table. &quot;Being... dead.&quot; Merlin winced. He definitely could&#x27;ve phrased that better. Arthur was silent for a few long moments before he finally spoke up, &quot;death is the best way to put it, but I don&#x27;t know if I really was. I was... aware ,but not completely. It was more like being asleep, but deeper.&quot; Arthur lifted his head a bit, so Merlin could see the contemplative expression on his King&#x27;s face. &quot;It was cold. And dark. And both quiet and loud at the same time. I felt like I was drowning,-&quot; Merlin huffed a bit at that. He was buried in the waters of Avalon, after all. &quot;-but also like I had too much air in my lungs... and it felt like I was floating.&quot; Merlin hummed in acknowledgement, not entirely sure what to do with that information. He didn&#x27;t know why he had asked anyway. Morbid curiosity, he supposed. &quot;I could hear you, too.&quot; Arthur continued, drawing Merlin from his mind. &quot;You, what?&quot; &quot;I could hear you, when you talked to me at Avalon. I heard everything.&quot; &quot;Oh.&quot; The warlock breathed in shakily, trying to keep his emotions in check. His eyes stung a bit at that. He thought that he felt relief. Relief that all his speeches and cries hadn&#x27;t gone unheard. That they hadn&#x27;t been in vain. &quot;You helped me come back. I could&#x27;ve been there forever if I didn&#x27;t-&quot; Arthur visibly swallowed, his Adam&#x27;s apple bobbing, &quot;if I didn&#x27;t know you were waiting.&quot; Merlin let out a soft, watery laugh, &quot;well. I always had a hard time waking you up, but it did eventually happen.&quot; Arthur chuckled at that, before sobering again. &quot;It... it didn&#x27;t help that I could hear Gwen and Leon, and... everyone else. You&#x27;d think that hearing them would give me more reason to come back, but when they stopped coming... it just pushed me deeper.&quot; He breathed shakily, before clearing his throat. &quot;Ugh, I&#x27;m becoming a girl.&quot; Merlin ignored Arthur&#x27;s attempt at levity. &quot;We&#x27;ll find them.&quot; Arthur turned sharply toward him. He was blinking quickly, trying to hide the tears that Merlin knew he would deny were there. &quot;Gwen and the others. I have to believe that they can come back, too.&quot; The King sighed heavily, focusing his gaze on his hands, as he twirled his wedding ring around and around on his finger. &quot;They don&#x27;t have destiny on their side.&quot; &quot;No,&quot; Merlin admitted. &quot;But we do. They can be reincarnated. Stranger things have happened.&quot; He smiled, a hint of bitterness in the expression. &quot;We&#x27;ll get them back. We have to.&quot; Merlin was trying to convince himself just as much as he was trying to convince Arthur. It may have been a long shot; but with the sun pouring in through the windows, lighting up Arthur&#x27;s hair in a way Merlin was so familiar with, and Arthur, sitting there with a regalness that only he could possess, Merlin thought that if anyone could do it, it&#x27;d be his King . Arthur turned back toward Merlin. The hope he saw there was hope that Arthur couldn&#x27;t bear to crush. &quot;Of course we will.&quot; The blonde smiled, a genuine smile. &quot;I am, after all, pretty amazing.&quot; Merlin snorted and rolled his eyes, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t go that far. You can&#x27;t even cook some soup.&quot; &quot;The instructions were unclear!&quot; &quot;Yeah, yeah, big guy.&quot; The warlock laughed, turning away from Arthur. &quot;I&#x27;ll make us some food, just try not to burn down the house while I go change. Maybe I&#x27;ll take you shopping for some groceries.&quot; &quot;Ugh, shopping.&quot;</span> <a href="#" class="summary-toggle">[ + ]</a></div><div class="stats"><div class="stat-item"><strong>Rating:</strong> General Audiences</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Archive Warning:</strong> No Archive Warnings Apply</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Category:</strong> F/M, Gen</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Fandom:</strong> Merlin (TV)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Relationship:</strong> Gwen/Arthur Pendragon (minor)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Character:</strong> Merlin (Merlin), Arthur Pendragon (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Additional Tags:</strong> Fluff and Angst, Humor, One Shot, Domestic Fluff, domestic friends, Arthur Pendragon Needs a Hug</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Published:</strong> 2020-08-09</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Words:</strong> 1125</div></div></div><div class="work-entry"><h2 class="title"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://download.archiveofourown.org/downloads/1140934/A%20Slumbering%20Idiot.pdf?updated_at=1390025745" target="_blank">A Slumbering Idiot</a></h2><div class="summary"><span class="summary-short">Arthur is very angry with Merlin and Merlin tries to make up for it.

Disclaimer:Merlin is owned by the BBC and Shine. No copyright infringement is intended and no profit is being made. Don&#x27;t send us to the dungeons. Arthur is cross with Merlin. Oh so very cross! Once again, Merlin managed to run off his mouth (regardless of the fact that it’s a very pretty mouth) in front of Father. Arthur had to stop Merlin from rambling off in the King’s presence, and now the King is upset with Arthur, and Arthur is angry at Merlin. “I don’t want to see you tonight,” Arthur said to Merlin since he is now responsible for an extra few hours of training. It was supposed to be his evening off, and he was going to spend it with Merlin doing unspeakable things. Now he has to stay up nearly half the night practicing with Leon and Owaine. Morgana of course is giggling because she loves it when Arthur messes up and is punished. The person who should be punished is Merlin, of course. “I promise to atone for my mistake, Sire,” Merlin had said when Arthur scowled at him and shooed him away. Arthur scoffs and walks away. He will atone indeed, Arthur is sure. After a very long night of fighting and exercise, Arthur makes his way to his chambers. The door handle sticks, Arthur is sure Merlin has something to do with it. Also, a strange scent seems to be engulfing Arthur’s senses. He finally manages to get the door and finds that candles are everywhere. That explains the strange smell. This is Merlin’s idea of atoning for his mistake? A would-be romantic night with candles? There isn’t even any fare laid out. Arthur is famished. Where is Merlin? Then Arthur turns towards his bed and sees him. He understands and smiles. Merlin is tied to Arthur’s bed, naked, waiting to atone for his faults. Except, the idiot has fallen asleep.

Notes English is my second lenguage so Im deeply sorry for all the horribly stupid grammar mistakes you may find in the way. I try my best but English is a bitch. Arthur&#x27;s day was going good, he may even said suspiciously good: so of course he accidentally walked into Merlin doing something remarkably idiotic. To absolutely no one surprise, Sir Gwaine was right beside him. Sometimes Arthur questioned his own calling of making Gwaine a knight. The man was tough as a tree, the problem lay in that the roughness of the man&#x27;s body seemed to also account for his head. The music was playing all around the castle, after all the King&#x27;s birthday was more than a good excuse for a festival. So finding two people walking around the castle- even so late at night- was not unheard of. On the contrary it seemed like just almost everyone was awake and celebrating. It took Arthur&#x27;s less than a second to realize that the two men were clearly drunk- also not surprising given the knowledge that Gwaine had a tendency to drink up an entire tavern and force Merlin to do so as well. What did stop Arthur on his tracks was that they were dancing. It was not drunk-dancing, nor it looked ceremonial at any aspect of the word, what it did look like was… Fun. And intimate. Merlin had a wicked grin plaster on his face as he put his hand on Gwaine&#x27;s, pushing the other man against him and holding him close, both arms around the knight waist. It was bizarre. Arthur almost opened his mouth, ready to make fun of the two of them when Gwaine started laughing. They were so sloppy and drunk only by the knight laughing they lost their balance, crashing against the wall. Merlin let out a huffle pain noise, giggling like an idiot. Arthur knew just how much the knight and his gourmet weight, so he could only wonder how Merlin was still standing. &quot;Oh lord, Merlin are you okay?&quot; Asked Gwaine, still pressing the servant against the wall. Merlin was too overtaken by laughter to speak any sensible words, instead he nodded, lowering his hands a little bit, now holding the other by the hip. &quot;I&#x27;m fine. I&#x27;m stronger than I look like&quot; Argue Merlin, with a playful grin. Which was off, because the teasing and the banter was usually directed towards Arthur. He figured Merlin was just an insolent ass to about anybody but… But it still made Arthur&#x27;s eye twitch. What came next was even worse. &quot;I hope so…&quot; Mumbled Gwaine, cupping Merlin&#x27;s face and leaning in. Arthur&#x27;s jaw dropped and he instinctively walked backwards not trying to pry on his friends and then… Then he got curious to see what Merlin would do. Was the manservant about to smack the knight? Well, probably not, he was too nice and he liked Gwaine a little too much. But what would he say? How would he reject one of his closest friends? Arthur had yet to see Merlin do something truly selfish- not counting how terrible of a servant to the future king he was. So instead of walking away he waited… And his manservant didn&#x27;t do any of the things the prince predicted (as per usual). On the contrary he looked eager to deepen it. They were kissing. Properly kissing, clinging to each other and moving towards the rooms… Arthur moved out of the pure hunch in his guts, turning backwards and accidentally bumping against the huge cart that was covered top to bottom with plates and goblins. The sound was so loud it made the prince jump in his place. &quot;Arthur?&quot; The blonde clench his jaw, feeling the hotness take over his neck and ears. He was royalty, he had no reason to be nervously stumbling against plates around his own castle. &quot;Merlin!&quot; He shouted instead, pretending to be unaware of what was just happening in front of him &quot;Where on earth were you? And give me one valid reasons as to why this plates were just laying here&quot; &quot;To be fair, sire, they were on the cart&quot; Commented Gwaine with a shit eating smile. Arthur narrowed his eyes, simply glaring at the knight who cleared his throat and gave Merlin a pointed look. &quot;I&#x27;m sorry Arthur I was taking the cart to the kitchens…&quot; The red of his cheeks was so fiercely streaking it took Arthur a minute to stop staring. Nonetheless he knew exactly what to say. &quot;So I suppose you have a good excuse for the plates to be here and not with you?&quot; Merlin bite down on his lip, clearly trying to come up with something reasonable to say. Arthur simply raise a hand, feeling his stomach doing stunts &quot;Just take them to kitchen, Merlin&quot; &quot;Of course, sire&quot; He added the last word with an edge that would usually make Arthur resist a smile but now brought a bitter flavour to his mouth. &quot;Just do your job...Both of you&quot; &quot;What did I do now?&quot; Mumbled Gwaine under his breath, clearing talking to Merlin. Arthur fought the impulse to punch the knight. It took over him so fast it could&#x27;ve been the result of the embarrassment of making a mess out of the silverware. Either way the heat took over his whole body, settling heavy on his stomach. It was so intense he turned around, walking so fast it was more sprinting than walking until he reached his chambers slamming the door shut and feeling the anger smoothing out. It was probably the wine, he told himself while undressing. Gwaine and wine are never a good combination, and he had to admit seeing the two men like that was not a pleasant watch. He was not fond of the kingdom&#x27;s tradition towards people&#x27;s choices in who to love or how to love, so usually he turned a blind eye whenever he could. Afterall how different was loving Gwen to Merlin loving… But there was no way Merlin loved Gwaine, was it? They were just drunk and having fun. A lot of knights did so, when they thought nobody was paying attention. It was fine by Arthur, at the end of the day it was all about giving some freedom to the others. But Merlin loving Gwaine? It didn&#x27;t make sense. They were close, Arthur knew that much, the two spent hours getting drunk and talking their tongues off. Usually Gwaine would follow Merlin around the training field, making jabs and helping the manservant annoy the king. But that was just friendly interactions… Sure, the knight looked a notch like a lost hyperactive puppy trailing behind his owner but… No. There was no way. Arthur did them a favour, interrupting the moment of insanity and breaking thru the drunk gaze that could make one do just about anything. One day they would thank him. *** &quot;Rise and shine!&quot; Shouted Merlin, opening the curtains. Arthur groaned an insult, twisting and turning in his bed. He picked under his pillow, glaring at a very chipper Merlin. The man was all but hangovered, he was so over the moon it looked like he was about to start glowing at any minute. &quot;Do you need to do that everyday?&quot; Spit out Arthur, slipping out of his sheets and feeling the soreness of where he hit against the cart. &quot;Well, it is my job, so unless you feel like realising me from my duty&#x27;s&quot; Arthur snorted, playfully pushing Merlin out of the way. The boy&#x27;s blue eyes glimmer with something so cheerful it soften Arthur&#x27;s grumpy mood. &quot;If you keep it this way I may just do it&quot; Retaliated Arthur with a grin. Merlin helped him get dressed without shutting up for a single second. It was like having an insanely big parrot, designed just to make Arthur&#x27;s life a living hell. The brunette chuckled at something Arthur mumbled, cocking his head to a side. It was a slight movement but it let Arthur take at glance at the length of his manservant throat, and the bruises that were hiding under the red neckerchief. Arthur surprised himself reaching towards Merlin&#x27;s neck, the movement was soft and completely out of care. Which was not all that bad. It was long past the time where he pretended the man was just a servant, not that Arthur would personally let Merlin know he was the closest of his friends, but neither did he intentionally hide how much he cared. The problem was, to any idiot with eyes these were clearly love bites. He cringed at the mere thought, stopping his hand in the air before he could make the situation any more awkward. Merlin brows met each other as he pulled a grin, looking down at Arthur&#x27;s tentative hand that was still floating in between them. So the prince acted fast, cleaning the dust out of Merlin&#x27;s shoulder. &quot;You could at least try to look presentable for work, Merlin&quot; The boy rolled his eyes, finishing with Arthur&#x27;s armour and pushing a lock of hair out of the blonde&#x27;s eyes. &quot;I&#x27;m presentable, you are just a prat&quot; He had a busy day that set in motion too abruptly for the prince taste, he took his breakfast quickly, running to the a conference with his father and one of his trusties ally, to then spend the good part of two hours helping the king to solve issues he barely understood, all of this was fastly follow by an equally hurried lunch and before he could blink he was stopping Lancelot&#x27;s strikes while the other knights laugh and chatter around them. It was always like this when his father&#x27;s birthday arrived, the kingdom was a mess of tasks he was forced to achieve without getting too drunk or too exhausted. He wished it could simply last a day and not an entire week. &quot;Bloody hell&quot; He grumbled when he fell flat on his back. Lancelot frowned, offering a hand and pulling the prince to his feet. &quot;Is everything okay, sire?&quot; The brown eyes were covered with actual concern. &quot;Hectic week&quot; He replied with a shrugged, clapping Lancelot&#x27;s shoulder and smiling. In the moment he almost felt proud of controlling his temper in front of the lost fight, then he heard Merlin laughing. Not just his regular chuckled or cover up scoffs, an actual to god laugh. Loud enough to caughted the attention of both Lancelot and Arthur. Gwaine was to his side, leaning in and whispering something at the boy&#x27;s ear. The blue eyes were squeezed together, as he tried to keep his laughter down. &quot;What so funny, Merlin?&quot; Barked Arthur, feeling his mood drop and the exhaustion kill his patience. Merlin dropped the smile, moving organically in front of Gwaine, like his small trainless self could hide the rather bulky man. &quot;Nothing really&quot; He replied quickly, cheeks red and eyes watery from laughing to hard. Merlin was all contrast, the black hair over the pale skin, the blue eyes next to the usually red cheeks and glossy lips normally tear up by the constant bitting. It almost distracted Arthur from his annoyance. But then his eyes found the corner of a bruise, barely showing under the neckerchief and the implications that brought. What could they possibly have done once he left? Once he ran away to be more fair. Did Gwaine put those there? The thought of the knights propously marking Merlin made Arthur… Furious. Which was right down delirious. &quot;Come on, Sir Gwaine, why don&#x27;t you tell us all what&#x27;s so funny it makes my manservant forget his place?&quot; The knight&#x27;s face stiffen only for a moment, to quickly regain his usual nonchalant expression. &quot;Well, we were remembering your little accident from last night&quot; He grin to then tilt his head with everything but respect &quot;Sire&quot; Arthur snorted, but it was broken and bitter, Lancelot looked at him with more worry than before, like he just knew what was about to go down. &quot;Come on, Gwaine&quot; The words were friendly enough to cover up the actual rage that was starting to rush all over Arthur&#x27;s body. It wasn&#x27;t about him kissing Merlin, that was okay… Well, that was not bad. But why hurt him? Why marking the man like a common cow? He had seen the bruises, they were too purple and big and he hated them. And sure, Merlin was an ass, and he was not allowed to even admit they shared a friendship, but they did and Arthur cared. And… And… He was pissed? &quot;Oh, Arthur, don&#x27;t be so sensible, it was just a joke&quot; Tease Gwaine, moving forward and playing with his sword. &quot;I know.&quot; Replied the blonde, seeing the sun shine against his blade as he striked down. Gwaine was quick on his feet, strong and one could even argue smart to the extent of his sword. But Arthur was mad, overtaken by the thought of being humiliated, of letting Gwaine with Merlin in the middle of night, drunk and touchy. Their swords were crashing with enough strength to shake their stand. &quot;Where was this energy with Lancelot? I have to say, sire, he&#x27;s getting a special treatment&quot; Laugh Gwaine, actually having fun with the mad man that was about to cut him into pieces. &quot;Shut up&quot; Grumbled the prince, knocking him out of his feet only to be dragged down. And just like that they were both swordless, just rolling in the dirt like twelve years old. Gwaine managed to punch him square in the jaw, and Arthur retaliated with a kick on the stomach. &quot;That&#x27;s enough.&quot; announced Sir Leon, grabbing Arthur by the armour and pushing for him to let go. Elyan, that was covering his face with the back of his hand, move closer yaking Gwaine from the floor and giving the knight a nasty glare. &quot;That hardly very knight wise of you&quot; Spat out Elyan, looking constipated by the control laugh. Arthur had to fight every bone on his body to not scream &#x27;He started it&#x27;, because it was not only childhood but also a lie. So instead he forced a smile, looking Gwaine straight into the eyes &quot;Why does it always end up like this with you?&quot; &quot;Because different to the saying I do bite&quot; Wait… Arthur frowned, dismissing him with the back of his hand. There was no way he was actually talking about Merlin. Unless he somehow knew how much it had bothered the prince… But how would Arthur even know about it? Or more accurately, how would Gwaine know that Arthur knew? Or care for that matter. He walked towards Merlin, who was not even hiding the smile. &quot;Very refined&quot; &quot;Shut up, Merlin&quot; &quot;No, I mean it, one of your best&quot; &quot;Merlin&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m just trying to be supportive&quot; They were walking towards the castle, moving in sync even if the brunette was naturally sloppy and seemed to trip with his own boots. Arthur had to stop and salute multiple of his father&#x27;s guests, wishing he wasn&#x27;t covered in sweat and dirt. When Lady Odan appeared in their way, he regret every life decision he had ever made. The woman was the prettiest he had ever laid eyes upon. Not gorgeous in the way Gwen was, who emoted kindness and yet confidence with her every movement, but regal and sharp in such a manner only beauty could explain. Her face was pale and her cheekbones we&#x27;re almost as prominent as Merlin&#x27;s… Which was a weird comparison to make, Arthur realized. Either way the blue in her eyes could let a man breathless, in the same way sometimes Merlin stare… &quot;Sire?&quot; Said again Lady Odan, looking entertained by how lost Arthur was. He shook away the thoughts, tenderly grabbing Odan&#x27;s hand and kissing it. &quot;My lady&quot; He replied with an apologetic smile &quot;I&#x27;m sorry to find you in such way&quot; &quot;Don&#x27;t apologise, it&#x27;s good to see a true knight once in a while&quot; Replied the girl, her lips curl up into a smile &quot;But hopefully I will see you again at the banquet&quot; &quot;You will&quot; Promise Arthur, giving a side smile that could be considered a bit flirty if… &quot;What was that?&quot; Asked Merlin, almost offended. Arthur needed to blink twice before even looking at his servant. &quot;I beg your pardon, Merlin?&quot; The words came out in a chuckle, as the blue eyes found Merlin&#x27;s. &quot;Sorry I just-- I thought you and Gwen…&quot; He did some movements with his hands that were certainly not appropriate. They entered Arthur chambers, closing the doors behind them like they always did, even when they were supposed to let it open for other staff to walk in. &quot;Well, we were, I suppose… But it wasn&#x27;t fair, Merlin. More so with Lancelot in the picture&quot; Arthur felt his chest twisting, he was content with his decision, but that didn&#x27;t prevent it from hurting &quot;Why am I even telling you this? Go fetch my clothes, and heat the water for my bath&quot; *** In moments like this Arthur realized just how lucky he was. The banquet was going splendid, the food was good, the wine was doing its work, his clothes were royal and he felt like a proper prince and not just some prat that would fight wanna be knights in the literal dust. And of course, Lady Odan was more than he could hope for. It wasn&#x27;t Gwen, but it felt right. The way she laughed at his comments and carried the conversation with ease, it was good. Until he saw Merlin serving Gwaine. The knight put a hand on the servant&#x27;s back, to anyone else it probably looked friendly, after all you couldn&#x27;t hide from how obvious their friendship was. The same for the servant and Lancelot&#x27;s bond. It was uncommon for a simple manservant to be so close with the prince knights but at the end of the day it was also harmless. The point remained in that bloody hand. It was just a touch, but Arthur could hear the chains clacking at how possessive it really was, and worse how nonchalant Merlin was about it. He truly didn&#x27;t seem to care, if anything he looked like he was enjoying himself, leaning in and letting the other man whisper things… &quot;Arthur?&quot; Call Lady Odan. She looked like she had already repeated herself &quot;Is everything okay?&quot; &quot;What?&quot; He mumbled and then he remembered himself, straightened up and smiling &quot;Sure, I was just keeping an eye on my knights. They have a tendency to over drink&quot; It was just a hand in someone&#x27;s back, so one could only wonder why this led into the prince of Camelot drinking more than Percival could handle- which was a lot. It came to his attention he was way too drunk when Sir Leon threw him an apple that hit him right in the middle of the eyes. Lady Odan let out a surprise noise, covering her mouth. The king in other hand let out the strongest laugh of the night &quot;I think is time you visit your chamber, Arthur&quot; The blonde nodded, doing his best to say his goodbyes to Lady Odan without doing something that could potentially get him beheaded if her dad was watching. It only got worse when he rose to his feet. The alcohol seemed to hit all together, making the man stumble and probably fall if it wasn&#x27;t for the scrawny hands that trap him by the waist. &quot;Sire&quot; Said Merlin with a smirk &quot;Let me assist you&quot; The walk to his chambers was rough. Arthur almost fell more than once and when they finally were half way through it he almost puked. &quot;You need to slow your drinking you cabbage head&quot; Scold him Merlin, holding his weight the best he could &quot;Not even Sir Percival was this drunk… Not even Gwaine!&quot; &quot;You would know wouldn&#x27;t you?&quot; Grumbled Arthur, letting go of Merlin and almost throwing himself against the door of his chambers only to get plaster against it. &quot;We close them, remember? Because of all the people walking around the castle&quot; Arthur barely answered him, looking at the boy&#x27;s long fingers searching for the key that was hanging from Arthur&#x27;s waist. Once the door was actually open he barged in, falling straight to the ground and standing up immediately, doing half of the way to his bed with the tip of his fingers against the floor. &quot;I&#x27;m fine, I&#x27;m fine, I&#x27;m fine&quot; He assured, grabbing the wooden column of the bed and collapsing onto the mattress. &quot;If you say it three times it becomes suspicious, Arthur&quot; The boy was resting against one of the wooden columns looking down at Arthur with a smile. &quot;At least let me take out your cape, your gonna choke with it&quot; So he did, he leaned in, unbuttoning the golden brooch and moving Arthur to a side so he could take the cape from under him. In the process Arthur&#x27;s eyes darted towards the servant&#x27;s neck again. He had always liked Merlin&#x27;s neck… That was weird. But true, he looked like a bird: all long neck and bones. The alcohol was definitely to blame when he reached for the other neck, softly touching the hurted skin. &quot;Don&#x27;t let people hurt you like this, Merlin&quot; He mumbled, raising his other arm and untying the neckerchief to get a better look at the damage &quot;People do this to claim others, don&#x27;t let them&quot; Arthur finally looked up Merlin&#x27;s eyes, who was looking at the prince like he had grown a horn. He really had some very beautiful eyes. Even more than Lady Odan. Also a very weird thought. Merlin finally seemed to break out of the shook, smirking. &quot;And that because as a servant I belong to the kingdom, don&#x27;t I? This is basically property damage&quot; He was teasing and trying to get under Arthur&#x27;s skin but his eyes were still glued to the prince&#x27;s. &quot;No. You don&#x27;t let no one own you, that&#x27;s an order&quot; Arthur chuckled, brushing his thumb against the bites that were all down to Merlin collarbone &quot;If you break it you are gonna be committing treason&quot; Merlin snorted, and reached to get his neckerchief back, but Arthur moved away, putting the piece of fabric around his own neck. &quot;We just took the one choking hazard, Arthur…&quot; Started scolding Merlin, looking at the prince like he was tired of protecting him. &quot;It smells nice&quot; Blurt out Arthur, immediately turning red &quot;I mean nicer than I expected, not that I expected to smell like anything… I mean I don&#x27;t think about how you smell, wait, but if I did… Not that I do, I&#x27;m just trying to convey if I did though about it I would think it would smell bad nor good, I&#x27;m--Im just gonna stop talking now&quot; Merlin sat at the end of the bed, laughing just as hard as he did with Gwaine in the training field &quot;Should I be concerned that someone poison you?&quot; &quot;With my luck, someone probably did&quot; Groaned Arthur, sitting up. He put a hand on Merlin&#x27;s neck again, feeling the weight growing bigger in his chest. It was a horrible, mushy, uncomfortable, awkward, painful feeling. He hated the idea of Gwaine all over his friend, biting, sucking and kissing. It felt like a personal attack, like he had targeted something closer to Arthur than his right hand. He put the other hand on Merlin&#x27;s cheek and stared at him for a moment. &quot;Would you promise me, Merlin?&quot; The words were barely a whisper &quot;Tell me you won&#x27;t let them do this again&quot; Merlin narrowed his eyes, a frown obscuring his face as he smiled at Arthur. &quot;I promise&quot; *** Things were smooth after that. Arthur did everything in his power to try to forget the little incident of the neckerchief and the smudgy pledges and to his surprise Merlin didn&#x27;t even say a word about it. He didn&#x27;t even ask for the neckerchief back, which led the piece of fabric to rest in one of Arthur&#x27;s drawers. Merlin even fetched himself a replacement in a very deep purple colour, the prince liked it, just not as much as the scarlet one. And all of that was great until he walked at the wrong place at the wrong time. They were on a hunting trip, just the knights and himself. And of course, Merlin. The boy was like a shadow to Arthur, so when they settled camp and lost track of the brunette for the good part of an hour he worried. This was not a new occurrence, Merlin had a tendency to disappear to later reappear in the most ridiculous type of trouble. This time it was Lancelot the one who noticed how nervous and over the place the prince was. &quot;What&#x27;s bothering you, sire?&quot; Asked the man with a pointed look. &quot;Have you seen Merlin?&quot; The words were basically blurted out as he searched the forest with a glare. &quot;He&#x27;s looking for wood&quot; &quot;He&#x27;s been looking for wood for an hour?&quot; The blue eyes narrow, unconvinced. &quot;Well, Gwaine joined him and you know how they get&quot; Arthur&#x27;s throat got dried and he couldn&#x27;t help but to jerk away like someone had just slapped him. &quot;What is that supposed to mean?&quot; Lancelot raised an eyebrow, opening his mouth and closing it before actually speaking. &quot;That they are idiots together&quot; How did that anger Arthur? He wasn&#x27;t sure. What he did know was that they were on a hunting trip not a honeymoon and that his manservant should be bringing wood and not… &quot;Come on, let&#x27;s go find the idiots&quot; Grumbled Arthur, looking intoxicated. Lancelot&#x27;s face shifted, appearing constipated for a minute but then he obeyed without a single word. They scatter the surrounding woods, walking like they were actually hunting and not looking for two morons who thought they could use Arthur&#x27;s time for their own satisfaction… Even if hunting was not really a serious matter… Because he knew neither of them would actually compromise his well being. It was just a hunting trip… Perhaps he should just drop it, let them have their fun and scream at Merlin when they got back. As much as he loved calling the both of them useless, they were far from that, they fought side by side with Arthur at every chance they had… Merlin had probably saved his life more time he could count. Was he being ungrateful? Should he just let them have this one thing? And annoying, horrible, skin crawling thing? He was about to turn around when he heard the laughs. For a second he was thankful Lancelot had taken another route because he felt his own face going flat. Merlin and Gwaine were not kissing, nor doing anything worse. They were simply sitting down on the floor, a pile of twigs in between them. It took the prince a moment to understand what the actual hell was the tiny structure they were building. A house. They were making a house out of twigs. So they were just two idiots that had found their way into the wine reserves. He was too far away to hear what they were saying to each other, but whatever it was seemed to bring a smile out of the knights who leaned in kissing Merlin&#x27;s cheek. &quot;Arthur&quot; Lancelot had appeared behind him, looking… Scare? &quot;I beg you, do not act before they can explain it. This may not be what…&quot; &quot;He&#x27;s in love&quot; The words slip out of Arthur&#x27;s mouth without the prince having any power in controlling them. &quot;How is he in love with that brute?&quot; &quot;What?&quot; The knight looked so confused that in any other circumstances it would have been comical &quot;Sire, they are good men and forgive me for speaking out of place but I don&#x27;t believe they deserved to be punished…&quot; Arthur&#x27;s whole body felt unreal, detached from his hurting chest and tied up throat. When he spoke again it was in broken words. &quot;What? You know where my heart lays, Lancelot. I would never punish someone simply for who they...Who they chose to love&quot; His eyes were burning now, as Merlin took one of the twigs and threw it at Gwaine&#x27;s way, making the man stand up and unleashing a raise away from their tiny twig house. In good fortune they went the other way, letting Arthur and Lancelot staring at their little playground. The prince&#x27;s eyes were glued to the fucking house, hypnotized by the idea of being that childish with someone. But not just anyone, Merlin. His manservant was in love. Lancelot, who was clearly trying to fix together the situation, narrowed his eyes, studying the prince like it was the first time they met. Eventually the pieces drop in place because the knight let out a small &quot;oh&quot;. &quot;Arthur…&quot; &quot;I don&#x27;t get it&quot; Confessed the prince, cocking his head to a side and shaking the feeling of loss out of his bones &quot;Well, but I guess is nothing I should get, isn&#x27;t it?&quot; &quot;Arthur are you…&quot; Lancelot put a hand on his shoulder, the brown eyes filled with sorrow. &quot;Let&#x27;s go&quot; *** Merlin wouldn&#x27;t shut the hell up. He talked and talked and talked and Arthur was incapable of saying a word in return. It was later in the night and they were laying in Arthur&#x27;s tent, head to bottom, trying to get some rest. And when Arthur couldn&#x27;t handle anymore he broke. &quot;Why don&#x27;t you go with Gwaine?&quot; He burst out, feeling his face getting red &quot;I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;s gonna appreciate the constant babbling more than I do&quot; &quot;Don&#x27;t lie to me, Arthur&quot; tease Merlin, pushing the prince feet &quot;I know you like my babbling&quot; He did like the babbling. Which was so painfully annoying. Why did he like the babbling? The whole matter was disturbing. &quot;No I don&#x27;t&quot; He was on the break of pouting &quot;Now shut up or I&#x27;m gonna let you walk back to Camelot&quot; Instead of shutting up, like someone with a half functional brain would do, Merlin sat up, turning around until he was at Arthur&#x27;s side. &quot;So what&#x27;s wrong with you, anyways?&quot; &quot;Merlin do I need to remind you I&#x27;m the crown prince and not you, so I&#x27;m the one who decides when we talk?&quot; &quot;Clotpole head&quot; Mumbled Merlin under his breath, turning around and leaving the prince to speak to the back of his head. &quot;Merlin!&quot; &quot;What? I thought you didn&#x27;t want to talk&quot; The servant words were less cheerful than before making the prince&#x27;s chest feel heavy with someone dangerously similar to guilt. &quot;But I&#x27;m the one who decides that, Merlin&quot; Argue the prince reaching for the manservant shoulder without much thought &quot;Don&#x27;t be a girl&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m obeying, my liege&quot; The brunette said, not without making the title sound obloquy. &quot;Merlin…&quot; Arthur started, stabbing a finger in Merlin&#x27;s side getting a small jab and a giggle. Nonetheless Merlin didn&#x27;t speak up, still looking firmly at the other side of the tent. Which leaves the prince with nothing but the obligation to pick at the manservants ribcages again, and again, and again. Surely enough at the time fifth time, Merlin was openly laughing and throwing his hand into the air, pushing the crown prince back by the face. &quot;Let go, dollophead!&quot; Snicker the man, folding himself in two so the blonde couldn&#x27;t access his sides. &quot;That&#x27;s no way to speak to your prince!&quot; Replied Arthur, with a sneer still picking at any piece of uncovered body Merlin had. The servant crawled away, getting out of the tent and running into the night. Arthur could have just let him, and stayed inside laughing at Merlin&#x27;s over exaggerations, instead he got up on his feet and started chasing the boy. &quot;You have the foot coordinating of a drunk baby lamb, Merlin&quot; He shouted, as he trail behind the stumbling servant. Merlin may have been sloppy but he was faster than most, which was a remarkable quality in someone who always managed to be late. &quot;So you admitted a baby lamb could outrun you?&quot; Tease the boy as they run past Sir Leon. The knight instinctively standt up, ready to kill or die. &quot;Everything okay, Sire?&quot; Asked the man, looking wired up. &quot;It&#x27;ll be better once I beat Merlin&#x27;s useless talkative annoying ass into the dust!&quot; Arthur may be wrong but he could have swore Sir.Leon rolled his eyes as he collapsed against the ground next to the fire. They run right into the woods, not even stopping to the possibility of actual danger. Finally Merlin&#x27;s feet got entangled between some vanes, making the young servant stop and just by a second avoid falling face first to ground. He weeze, breathing heavily at his almost fall when the huge royal ass that was chasing him crashed against his back, tackling him to the ground. &quot;Arthur!&quot; He shriek, twisting in his place getting face to face with a breathless and giggling future king of Camelot. The blonde wished he could see better in the dark only to appreciate Merlin&#x27;s face of defeat. &quot;Apologise&quot; Arthur demanded, with a smirk so wide it was almost arrogant. &quot;You are the one who&#x27;s chasing me into the woods like a mad man!&quot; Complained Merlin, trying to get loose of Arthur&#x27;s grip, which was answered with the blonde taking hold of both the servant&#x27;s hands and pushing them against the floor. &quot;You ignore me!&quot; Merlin laughed at that, letting his head fall to the side &quot;How could I ever commit such a treason, sire?&quot; &quot;You are the worst servant in the five kingdoms, Merlin&quot; &quot;And you are the biggest prat&quot; Merlin said with a smile, his words playful but sweet. Arthur&#x27;s next response was creeping out of his mouth when Merlin kicked him in the stomach, making him whimper and letting the rather small man push him off himself and forcing the prince down. It was a surreal view, Merlin smirking and hovering over him. His throat dried up and his limbs felt too light to push the servant off his body. Besides, the pressure of other body gently pressing against his was the kindest type of contact he had endorsed in a while. Actually, it was more than nice and every inch of his body hated the idea of Gwaine being in his place, enjoying Merlin&#x27;s company like he did. The prince&#x27;s hands wonder, holding Merlin&#x27;s shoulder unsure what to do next. The manservant&#x27;s face changed as he took in the blonde&#x27;s silence, quickly getting to his feet and offering a hand. &quot;Come on, Sire, I&#x27;m sorry&quot; Arthur slapped the hand away, suddenly coming back into his body. &quot;You are gonna be sorry when I gave you the list of chores you have yet get done&quot; *** Arthur started collecting moments where he felt like ripping Gwaine&#x27;s head off. Sometimes it was small things like seeing them brush shoulders or hands, some other it was whispers and chuckles, more often than not it was the knight&#x27;s bloody hand always placed in his friend&#x27;s body. It always striked Arthur right in the gut. The most remarkable of those occasions was when Merlin broke his promise. It was the end of a terribly long day, he had spent most of it with his father who seemed to become more drastic with magic every day that went by. This time it was a young girl, who&#x27;s house had caught on fire and her younger siblings were there to testify it was of her doing. The girl cried and screamed, swearing she didn&#x27;t intend for it to happen. She had no control over her powers. &quot;I was born with it! It&#x27;s not my fault!&quot; She had hollowed as the guards took her to her cell. His father, who looked tired but not overwhelmed by the pain in the poor girl&#x27;s voice, had decided the most adequate punishment was death. Even if nobody was hurt in the fire. Even if she had no control over it. Even if Arthur fighted against it. So it was not a stretch to say: the prince had a long day. &quot;What do you think, Merlin&quot; He asked once they were alone. The boy was awfully quiet, Arthur had seen the way he looked at the girl, like he would rather die in her place than let Uther get his way. The prince knew his manservant, he was aware Merlin didn&#x27;t seem to have the same primal reaction than most share about magic. After all the man was kind by heart, he never did any harm unless it was absolutely necessary. It was not a surprise seeing him like a beaten up puppy. &quot;What do you mean, sire?&quot; Replied the man, playing dumb. &quot;About the girl. Do you think my father made the right decision?&quot; The blue eyes narrowed, looking down to his feet &quot;I don&#x27;t think it is my place to question the king&#x27;s choices… But no, Arthur, I don&#x27;t think killing a girl for doing something she can&#x27;t control and she doesn&#x27;t understand is the right decision&quot; As he spoke his eyes filled with that wise glimmer Arthur sometimes feared. &quot;I&#x27;m afraid I agree with you, Merlin&quot; &quot;Then do something&quot; The words slip out of the servant immediately, as he walked closer to Arthur, sitting next to the prince on the edge of the bed &quot;You must do something&quot; &quot;What, Merlin? You know my father, he doesn&#x27;t reason when magic is involved&quot; Snapped the prince, holding his face between his hands. &quot;So make him. Are you willing to let a girl die before questioning your father&#x27;s judgment?&quot; &quot;Is not that easy…&quot; Whisper Arthur under his breath, regretting ever asking for the servant&#x27;s advice. &quot;I never say it was: but it&#x27;s fair and just&quot; The man&#x27;s words were firm as his voice became velvety and wise. &quot;You don&#x27;t understand what it&#x27;s like to carry all this weight&quot; Arthur opened his eyes, only to see the sheer patience and devotion in his friend&#x27;s eyes. Merlin trusted in him, he believed he could be a better King than his father was… All this pressure, all this hope. It was crushing. &quot;I don&#x27;t pretend I do, sire…&quot; &quot;Then stop talking like you know what you are saying, Merlin&quot; The burst of anger creeped through his words. The prince was tired of everyone&#x27;s expectations, he couldn&#x27;t bear it. Merlin was opening his mouth to answer when Arthur raised a hand, making him stop &quot;Go now.&quot; &quot;Arth--&quot; &quot;That was an order&quot; Bark the blonde, blue eyes charge with exhaustion. If Merlin was a proper servant, he would have apologized to then leave the chamber as respectfully as humanly possible. Instead the brunette jumped to his feet, storming out of the room like an angry kid. Arthur let out a grumbled, crushing against the bed. What was he supposed to do? He couldn&#x27;t just dismiss his father&#x27;s judgment, Uther was the king after all and the girl had used magic… There was no way around it. The crown prince could only think of one solution and even if he decided to take that route that wouldn&#x27;t help anybody. It was a patch not a solution. But what else could he do? Or more importantly, what would he do once he became king? Once someone used magic by accident under his watch? Would Merlin leave him when he realized the young heir could not throw away years upon years of criminalization against magic? More importantly did it even matter? Did it matter that a servant frowned upon his and his father&#x27;s decisions? *** It was around the time he and the girl were running through the woods he admitted to himself: it definitely mattered what Merlin believed. Not only for what his friend could feel towards Arthur- or stop feeling for that matter. It was about the principle: his servant was the head of his people. He represented them in many ways, he worked with the village, he talked with the town, he had friends and family among them and Arthur knew he would lay his life for Camelot, not only that but he was willing to do just about anything- except, maybe, letting the prince die- to preserve the kingdoms safety. But killing an innocent wouldn&#x27;t help the realm, it would only feed his father hatred. So, obviously, he broke the girl out and now was running from his own knights. How fitting. &quot;Here!&quot; He exclaimed hushed against the girl&#x27;s ear. They run right into a cave, Arthur putting his body in front of hers as the horses run in front of them. Not on their best fortune the knights stopped there, clearly searching the area. Another horse came from behind &quot;Where are they? Did you see the man&#x27;s face?&quot; It was Elyan, clearly eager to stop whoever decided to break Camelot&#x27;s laws. &quot;No&quot; Replied Sir Leon, he sounded dry and tired &quot;Where on earth is Gwaine and Percival?&quot; &quot;They were at the tavern, they must be on their way&quot; Arthur wasn&#x27;t sure how much time he spent hiding with the girl, but he needed to leave quickly. Him being missing could only drive suspicion to the situation. When he finally parted towards the castle he left the girl with a bag of gold,a dagger and clear instructions of which path to take hoping either of the two could help her survive. &quot;I will forever be grateful, My liege&quot; Muttered the girl, her brown eyes filled with respect. Arthur couldn&#x27;t take them out of his head. The way she looked at him was what he hoped for his kingdom: hope and trust. Nothing else. He made his way to his chambers, changing the dirty clothes and putting on a tunic, because before he could grant himself sleep there was something else to do. Merlin opened the door like a frightened hare, the blonde saw the relief that took over his expression when he realized it was the prince on the other side. The servant was prone to forget himself, never like this time tho: he jumped towards Arthur, hugging the crown prince and letting a heavy breath escape his throat. &quot;I couldn&#x27;t find you&quot; Cried out the boy, hugging tighter. Arthur froze. Not knowing how to react with the servant&#x27;s sudden outburst. &quot;Merlin?&quot; He teased, clapping the brunette on the back and smirking so wide he knew it probably looked like a sneer. The man let go, moving away abruptly and trying to put himself together &quot;Er--Sorry, I&#x27;m just happy you are not dead, my lord&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m glad about that too,&quot; joked Arthur &quot;can I come in?&quot; Merlin moved to a side, still looking embarrassed. The physician chambers were more cluttered than any other room in the castle: it didn&#x27;t matter where your eyes fell upon, there was probably some plant and potions. &quot;Where is Gaius?&quot; Wondered the prince feeling weird in his own body. &quot;Gone, some guards got attacked… But I have the feeling you may know something about it?&quot; Arthur shrugged, putting on a grimace of confusion &quot;Don&#x27;t know what you talking about, Merlin&quot; &quot;Oh, that is weird because I&#x27;ve been looking for you for a couple&#x27; hours. I figured you were dealing with the break out…&quot; Said the brunette with something wicked on his eyes. &quot;Break out?&quot; Remarked the prince, playing dumb enough it was clear as water he knew exactly what break out Merlin was talking about. &quot;The girl. Apparently she had some help, the knights are already out and looking for them, sire.&quot; Arthur made a small noise of surprise, nodding and passing around Merlin. &quot;That&#x27;s truly amazing&quot; &quot;Arthur…&quot; &quot;Merlin&quot; Mouthed Arthur with a smirk &quot;I can assure you my knights are the best. The only way this girl could get away is if she was help by someone who know the lands better than me&quot; Merlin&#x27;s smile was so big it looked comical, the servant sigh in relief letting himself fall against the table, both hands grabbing the side with force like he needed to stabilize himself. It was when the manservant leaned his head back, looking at the ceiling that Arthur caught the bite on his neck. It was just one and pretty well hidden, by the redness of it Arthur figure Gwaine was not with Percival at the tavern… When Merlin looked back again his face shifted, suddenly looking worried. &quot;What is it?&quot; Asked the man, clearly confused at the drastic change in Arthur&#x27;s demeners. &quot;Excuse me?&quot; &quot;Your face, Arthur, you look like you just saw a ghost&quot; Merlin tried to smile again but his face fell short. Arthur wondered what to do: he was no longer drunk; he couldn&#x27;t just ask Merlin not to let someone bite him, that was his private matter and not for him to comment. On the other hand what Merlin and Gwaine were doing was not technically legal and Arthur was already being merciful by letting them live their life freely. Nonetheless what was his reason to tell to stop? People didn&#x27;t even notice Merlin&#x27;s bruises, only he did. And even if someone else realized his manservant was walking around marked like livestock, they would assume it was some girl from the downtown, not one of the knights of Camelot. So why did Arthur want it to stop? What was it about it that made him feel so in despair? &quot;Whoever they are they better be worth breaking a promise to the crown prince&quot; Said Arthur, he pushed a grin to his face trying to be playful rather than confrontal. Merlin deserved a life and he could learn to respect that. The brunettes hands shot up to his neck, looking slightly horrify he walked towards the nearest surface with a reflection &quot;For the love of--&quot; &quot;You didn&#x27;t even know that was there?&quot; Asked Arthur, a little too curious for his own good. &quot;No I--Well, I asked them not to do this…&quot; &quot;Is okay Merlin, I was meaning to tell you…&quot; Arthur felt his guts sinking as he spoke &quot;I&#x27;m very sorry about the other night. I meant it, I don&#x27;t particularly like the idea of someone claiming you like that, but for me to make you promise what to do with yourself kind of defeats the point of not letting anyone own you&quot; The boy looked astonished, mouth half open and eyes narrowing &quot;Did you just apologise?&quot; Arthur did the only thing sensible, hitting Merlin on the chest and smirking as wide as physically possible. &quot;Don&#x27;t relish on it&quot; &quot;Oh I will&quot; Maybe that&#x27;s what Arthur needed, cleared his head and be true to his heart. Being a nobel was a known quality of his after all. For some reason instead of leaving in the moment, leaving things to be he decided to do something idiotic. He raised his hand, fingers lingering and barely brushing the pale skin now bruise and red &quot;I still don&#x27;t like it&quot; Merlin chuckled, leaning in against the touch &quot;Why? People are not gonna see it, you don&#x27;t need to throw me in the shacks for shaming you&quot; The prince snorted placing his whole hand against Merlin&#x27;s neck, holding &quot;If I haven&#x27;t throw you in the shacks already, I&#x27;m clearly not gonna do it now&quot; Merlin bite down his lips looking wired &quot;Good, my back can&#x27;t take the floor in the cells&quot; Arthur let his hand fall, walking away from Merlin feeling his body unfamiliar. It was clear then, he fucking hated this situation. *** Arthur was gonna murder Gwaine. There was no other option, just killing the moron. He could take the knight marking his servant, he could even live being constantly hunted by small indications of the two men&#x27;s affection. What the knight could not do is make Merlin sad. The brunette had started his week off, not screaming in the morning and no witty comments for breakfast, then he spent the whole time on the training field looking choke up, almost flinching everytime Gwaine came close to him. He was sitting next to Sir Leon, talking about Elyan&#x27;s great use of the shield when he catched Merlin offering Gwaine a sword, the knight took it without even glancing at the boy, looking anger and even pushing him with the shoulder as he made his way back to the center of the field. &quot;What was that about?&quot; He groaned, his voice getting higher than usual. Sir Leon needed a minute to catch up with the prince, looking at the two men for a few seconds before letting out a restrained sound. &quot;Oh, they been like that since yesterday&quot; Confirm the knight, shrugging &quot;Not sure what happen, they are usually closer than blood&quot; It wasn&#x27;t until dinner time that he truly felt like ripping the skin out of Gwaine&#x27;s bones. Merlin appeared- late as usual- with his supper and teary eyes. The servant tried his hardest to act like nothing was up, but Arthur stopped him on the spot. &quot;Merlin, what&#x27;s been bothering you?&quot; The boy shook his head, smiling shyly &quot;Nothing, sire. There&#x27;s anything else I can do for you?&quot; &quot;Yes, stop lying, you have been sulking all day what happened?&quot; Merlin simply stayed silent, his eyes set on his own feet. Oh, he was gonna stab someone tonight. &quot;Merlin, you know you can talk to me, right?&quot; Offered the prince, standing up and reaching to the boy&#x27;s shoulder. &quot;Is not nothing, sire&quot; He waited until the servant left the chambers, he even ate his supper, before standing up and walking steady towards the knights rooms. He crashed to the door of Gwaine&#x27;s chamber feeling his blood starting to boil. &quot;Arthur?&quot; Scream Gwaine, jumping on his chair and putting on a cocky smile &quot;You almost gave me a heart attack. The crown prince closed the door behind him more out of insitic than better judgement. Gwaine was standing up when the blonde charged against him, punching him square in the eye. &quot;What the f--&quot; Grumbled Gwaine, holding himself together without losing his balance. &quot;I don&#x27;t know what you did, but if he comes to my chambers crying again I will feed you to the dogs&quot; Burst out Arthur, spitting at his every word. The knight&#x27;s eyes narrowed, horror filling his expression as he understood what the prince words meant. &quot;You don&#x27;t understand…&quot; Started saying Gwaine. Arthur took him by the collar, forcing him to stand upright &quot;I don&#x27;t need to understand, Gwaine, don&#x27;t toy with him&quot; The knight hit the hands away from his body, pushing the prince away and letting out a bitter laugh, &quot;You don&#x27;t know what you are talking about, sire&quot; &quot;No reasons will--&quot; Gwaine look down at his feet, looking in the worst shape Arthur had ever seen him &quot;He is a sorcerer, My liege&quot; Arthur&#x27;s body went cold, knees losing his strength and head spinning uncontrollably. &quot;Go again?&quot; &quot;Merlin, he is a sorcerer&quot; Arthur snorted, there was no way this was real. The servant was such a clumsy, harmless, selfless mess, how could he be a warlock? &quot;You are joking, right?&quot; Mumbled the prince feeling his word turning around and twisting just to get caught on his throat. &quot;I--I know I should have come to you when I found out but…&quot; &quot;How do you know this?&quot; Demanded the prince, losing control over his tone that sounded broken and hurt. &quot;Yesterday, when he accompanied me on my quest; we were attack, sire. We were not gonna make it and Merlin… He used his powers, sire&quot; Arthur turned around, stumbling out of the room and trying to find his way towards his own chambers. He was barely aware of Gwaine&#x27;s voice behind him, begging for Arthur to forgive the servant. Eventually Gwaine stopped, collapsing against a wall and sliding down to the floor. His own father appeared in front of him eventually. &quot;Arthur, are you alright?&quot; Asked Uther, walking next to Gaius. &quot;Yes, father&quot; He feet his own gaze, unraveled and insane &quot;Gaius, where is Merlin?&quot; &quot;He already went back to our chambers, sire&quot; Smile the physician. *** Merlin was a sorcerer. The enemy, the one his father swore to extinct. Arthur couldn&#x27;t even remember himself until he knocked at Merlin&#x27;s door. &quot;Arthur?&quot; Asked Merlin, eyes red and cheeks puff. He should drag him to his father&#x27;s, expose him, cast him to death out of treason. He-- He collapsed against him, hugging the man close and feeling his body shiver, trembling out of panic. &quot;You idiot&quot; Groaned the prince, he pushed the warlock inside the chamber closing the door behind them still holding the servant close &quot;I know, Merlin&quot; The boy went stiff, trying to walk away from the grip. &quot;What do you know?&quot; Arthur snorted, running his hand thru his face &quot;About Gwaine,&quot; the relief cross through Merlin&#x27;s face and Arthur almost laughs at it &quot;and about your magic, Merlin&quot; The boy blink twice, choking on his words &quot;I swear, Arthur, I only use it to protect--&quot; &quot;I don&#x27;t care, Merlin&quot; Arthur grumbled, putting both of his hands on the other boy&#x27;s face, softly brushing his thumbs against Merlin&#x27;s cheekbones &quot;I should care, but not now… Know I don&#x27;t care…I’m not angry with you, I&#x27;ve seen enough to know that you are good. I--I, seen enough to understand magic is not inherently bad…I just wished you would’ve trusted me&quot; Merlin eyes were burning red, he nodded, confused and breathless, his eyes softening to then lean in brushing his lips against the prince. &quot;I&#x27;m so sor--&quot; Arthur pressed his mouth against Merlin&#x27;s, holding him and feeling how the restless feeling of pain that had been hunting him for months disappeared. All the years he shared with the warlock come crashing down to him. Every single time he felt like the weight of the world and his kingdom was simply too heavy for him to carry, how each and every time Merlin had been there, sometimes smirking and teasing and some other speaking softly, with that gravely voice the boy only uses under the light of the moon, assuring him he will protect him, promising Arthur that his future was bright, that they will change the world for better, all those tender words the crown prince could never shake he because he trusted Merlin. He loved Merlin. Even with magic in between them. They moved apart, the two pairs of blue eyes shimmery and hopefully. &quot;We&#x27;ll figure it all out, Merlin&quot; Said Arthur, knowing this was his turn to make promises about wonderful destiny&#x27;s &quot;I love you, and if that means loving magic so beat it&quot; Merlin scoff, sniffling and pressing his forehead against Arthur&#x27;s. &quot;Dollophead,&quot; He mutter, kissing Arthur&#x27;s cheeks and jaw &quot;You probably should know I love you too” “What about Gwaine?” Arthur’s voice was soft and filled with pain. “He knows I love you” Simply said Merlin, chuckling “I should probably talk to him…” “Later” Interrupted Arthur, cradling Merlin’s face and pressing sloppy kisses to his cheeks. The warlock nodded, kissing back and smiling so wide it could’ve lighting the whole kingdom “Later”</span> <a href="#" class="summary-toggle">[ + ]</a></div><div class="stats"><div class="stat-item"><strong>Rating:</strong> Not Rated</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Archive Warning:</strong> Choose Not To Use Archive Warnings</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Category:</strong> M/M</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Fandom:</strong> Merlin (TV)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Relationship:</strong> Merlin/Arthur Pendragon (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Character:</strong> Merlin (Merlin), Arthur Pendragon (Merlin), Gwaine (Merlin), Leon (Merlin), Lancelot (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Additional Tags:</strong> Jealous Arthur, Protective Arthur, Merlin is a Little Shit, gwaine can get it, gwaine is also a little bitch, Fluff, lancelot just wants to go home, Jealous Arthur Pendragon (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Published:</strong> 2020-11-12</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Words:</strong> 9130</div></div></div><div class="work-entry"><h2 class="title"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://download.archiveofourown.org/downloads/24924490/Ainsel.pdf?updated_at=1593155594" target="_blank">Ainsel</a></h2><div class="summary"><span class="summary-short">Young children of Camelot are being snatched from the embrace of their parents, mothers and fathers sob into melancholy darkness of the night.

Castle Guard witnesses proclaim a voracious army twinkling with sin arise from the Darkling Wood suddenly each night, just outside of Camelot&#x27;s boarders, before relentlessly soaring among clouds and targeting the public below. Arthur Pendragon, his knights, and Merlin are to investigate these areas of magical woodland where the missing children are suspected to be kept for reasons unknown. Merlin has warned Arthur, repeatedly, of the danger that lies on sacred land such as The Darkling Wood, owned by a monarchy of Royal Fae. Of course, his anxieties fall upon deaf ears, mocked as another one of his &#x27;funny feelings&#x27;. A blatant ignorance to the fact Merlin is never once wrong when it comes to his senses. That is how the Knights are ambushed. That is how Merlin becomes stranded, vulnerable, to the ancient forest Fae and into the uncharacteristically caring hands of an old enemy. Notes See the end of the work for notes CHAPTER ONE: The Ambush A flood of common women demanded presence with the king who, as of now, was regent prince Arthur. In place of a distraught, empty, Uther Pendragon, traumatized and numb to the betrayal of his daughter. Merlin feels guilt crawl up his throat knowing what he&#x27;s feeling is satisfaction, perhaps even bitter glory, at the tyrant&#x27;s sightless eyes. This guilt turns Merlin&#x27;s skin sickly pale and cold to the touch when watching how Uther&#x27;s troubles push his son into the depths of responsibility. The responsibilities of Camelot and the future Avalon weigh upon Arthur&#x27;s aching shoulders, and yet Merlin has the audacity to feel glee at Uther&#x27;s torment? His chest feels tight with guilt. The women barged into The King&#x27;s Hall, guards marching in behind them in a similar energetic panic, surprising to Merlin as he&#x27;s only ever seen the guards to be utterly contained. They had cried and cried, collapsing to their knees, as the guards apologized repeatedly on the interruption like a chorus of song. Arthur dismissed the guards in favour of his people Infront of him, watching as they heaved breath hungrily. &quot;My son!&quot; One woman cried, &quot;you have to get him back- your Majesty, please-!&quot; She had declared, her tender cheeks flushed red from the strain, tears gushing rapidly. Merlin stood to one side of the hall beside Gwen, nervously fidgeting in place, a concerned glance shared between himself and Gwen whilst she anxiously chewed her lip. Foul creatures of destruction and magic, they all declared between gasping shuddering wet breaths, swept Camelot&#x27;s lands from beyond the borders late at night. They took forms of ghastly shadows, shimmering stars casted amongst them, almost as if the cosmos itself had plagued Camelot and ravished the kingdom of her children as a form of vengeance. The darkness that emits from them as smoke from a fire reminds Merlin of the faceless Dorocha - icy spirits of the damned ruthless in their wake. Naturally, Arthur refused evils of sorcery to plauge amongst the innocent and at dawn strove out into the Darkling Woods with The Knights Of The Round Table. And Merlin. Merlin, the unfathomably loyal servant far beyond his duties. Arthur, too, seemed to attach memories of the Dorocha to these shadows as he would often cast glances towards Merlin between the moments of silence. Not that there where many, due to his aimless chatter, nonsensical yet met with Gwaine&#x27;s howling laughter as if he could possibly understand the slush of words Merlin would produce. An occasional &quot;I&#x27;m cold&quot; would whine from him, in which Arthur would bark a laugh, &quot;don&#x27;t be such a girl&#x27;s petty-coat, /Merlin/&quot; Merlin would huff, gripping the rains of his brown mare, and toss his eyes. &quot;You always say that,&quot; &quot;Because you&#x27;re always whining,&quot; Arthur simply retorted, smirking playfully, far too settled in the Darkling territory. Territory unwelcome to the kind of mortals, protectors of Camelot no-less. Merlin&#x27;s hairs tickled as his senses rose high in vibration, the golden essence of his magic swirling within him in retaliation to the foreboding threat. Sinister intent practically screamed to Merlin from the viper-like curling of forest vines and roots. He&#x27;d flinch to a breeze of whispers, caressing his ears that made him itch. Itch to be out of his own flesh. To simply be out, begone. These lands are sacred to the faerie kind, their soil soaked with sinful blood of intruders, and at that moment of realisation breath caught in Merlin&#x27;s throat. &quot;Arthur, I don&#x27;t-&quot; he started, brows furrowed as he casted his gaze to all surroundings. Trees, the trees are oak giants, blooming moss, looming over them in faux security. Arthur watched with an amused expression. His own brow was risen in contemplation to the bizarre behaviour. Not too bizarre, really, from his jumpy servant. They&#x27;d play this game on every hunt, after all. Typical Merlin. &quot;You&#x27;re acting like a cornered deer, Merlin, do finish your sentence. Your skittishness is making /me/ nervous,&quot; Arthur cleared his throat, the Knights watching with familiar looks of peculiarity. &quot;I really don&#x27;t think we should be here, it&#x27;s-&quot; he had paused once again, his sentence trailing off into the void of deep nothingness around them. Nothing other than shadows, and nature, and rocks, and shadows, shadows, shadows. His breath trembled from paled lips, fogged like a manifestation of his shivering anxieties. Arthur swallowed thickly at that, glancing back to Merlin beside him. He was tense. It&#x27;s unlike Merlin to just let his words evaporate, he has always held them as high regard. He&#x27;d speak with intention, certainty, and even, sometimes, on the very slight rare opportunity that Arthur would never truly admit to another soul, wisdom. His confidence was rare in servants, as Arthur frequently forgot Merlin was. Or perhaps it is bravery. Taking in his anxiousness, Arthur smirked to himself. Stupidity is far more likely. &quot;It&#x27;s what, Merlin? Too hot this time? Too damp? Too dark? Having another one of your &#x27;funny feelings&#x27;, is that it?&quot; Arthur finished with a bite, turning a sharp corner as the group ventured further and further down the woodland. &quot;To be fair, princess, there&#x27;s never not been a time these &#x27;funny feelings&#x27; haven&#x27;t turned out to be damned good senses,&quot; Gwaine declared, grinning broadly, his fond eyes trained to the servant. &quot;He&#x27;s like a blood hound, our Merlin.&quot; Merlin rolled his eyes aggressively at that, the smallest of smiles quirking at his lips. &quot;Ah, yes, thank you ever so much for your support dear friend, I suppose there are worst things to be compared to.&quot; He mumbled, slouching to the vauge bullying. &quot;And for the record, /sire/-&quot; Merlin snarled, sharp eyes narrowed to the bemused prince. Only Merlin could make such an honourable status seem like crusty scum. &quot;-, I was going to say sacred.&quot; The unintentional softness was not lost on the Knights. Whispering as if he knows more than people could ever hope to understand. &quot;We shouldn&#x27;t be here because this land is sacred,&quot; all knights shared a look between eachother, Lancelot seeming particularly uneasy, an undeniable sadness shining within them as he simply stared to Merlin. The knight cast his gaze down, blinking repeatedly, blinking away thoughts and wishes begging for Merlin to be granted peace from his burdens. He needs to remain focused, especially if Merlin senses danger. Arthur sighed heavily, slowing down the pace of his horse to be beside his distressed friend, practically nudging together, shoulder to shoulder. &quot;Alright, Merlin, and what makes you say that exactly, hm?&quot; The prince humoured. The Darkling Wood was notorious for the demonic happenings of sorcery, simply too far out from Camelot&#x27;s boarders to truly reign over the forest to drain it, however to feel? To feel the radiance of the wood? Arthur felt how thick the air was, heavy with droplets and fog. Arthur felt the prickling of certain branches against his armour, or how a bird&#x27;s chant would echo throughout. Just like every other forest, Arthur felt it&#x27;s earth. Arthur did not feel it&#x27;s life. He imagined it would be utter evil, to feel the presence of such decrepit child stealing fae. Monstrous with the twisted manipulation of sorcery, that is what makes this wood sacred, that is what let&#x27;s other sensitive souls know they are not welcome. However, Arthur can only imagine, and yet here is Merlin. Feeling with every fibre of his delicate, pinking fingertips that this land is Wrong. &quot;Can&#x27;t you feel it?!&quot; He suddenly yeld out, gazing to Arthur in disbelief. &quot;All of it- it&#x27;s- everything..&quot; &quot;I know there&#x27;s not much going on in that noggin of yours but you do still remember how to speak, don&#x27;t you? I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised,&quot; Merlin threw his arms up, gesturing all around them. &quot;It&#x27;s /vibrating/. Everywhere. Everyone! Every leaf, every breath, every twitch, every sound. the world is on fire, this land is ripe with-&quot; Merlin gritted his own teeth, wincing as he struggled to describe the unfathomable. &quot;-..malice,&quot; he breathed out, gradually letting his arms fall as his gaze trails back to Arthur. Time was still. Insects hesitated with their own little adventures as Arthur simply looked to Merlin. His head tilted slightly. Always, Merlin never ceases to amaze. He has never fathomed him, nor does he believe he ever will. How? &quot;You feel all that?&quot; The question gently hung in the air, the uncharacteristic change of tone like paint on a finished art- piece, politely asking to be observed. To be answered. Imidentially, Arthur noticed, and tore his gaze away. The prince doesn&#x27;t do &#x27;polite&#x27; and Arthur seethed in the vulnerability Merlin never fails to grab onto. &quot;Those poetry lessons weren&#x27;t wasted, I must say.&quot; Leon&#x27;s voice suddenly declared, shattering the building tension of both fear and awkwardness. All knights released a swift breath, laughing cheerfully amongst themselves. Merlin looked down to his horse, a beaming smile as he simply shakes his head. &quot;Besides. It&#x27;s not like you ever listen to me and my &#x27;funny feelings&#x27;, as you call them,&quot; the man shrugs, with a sharp smirk and a mastered unimpressed-but-not-surprised-Giaus-eyebrow-raise. Arthur pondered if the pair could geninuely be related. Arthur grins, roughly ruffling Merlin&#x27;s hair &quot;now you&#x27;re starting to get it!&quot; Merlin&#x27;s mouth drops open to that in a grinning manner, casting him a glare and a heartfelt &quot;You /prat/!&quot; Arthur shoved him a little, letting his horse pick up lace Infront of the group. &quot;Listen, /Merlin/, you can complain all you bloody well like I&#x27;m not leaving this place until we find all of those children back safely into the arms of their parents.&quot; He took in a sudden sombre breath, expression stilling. &quot;Not only to be kidnapped from their homes, but by the hands of sorcery? I can&#x27;t imagine their terror.&quot; At this serious indication the Knights nodded amongst themselves, a silence rumbling with loud thoughts whilst some subconsciously clutched to their sheathed swords. &quot;Fine. I will complain.&quot; Merlin had grumbled cockily, his nervous gaze still flitting to his surroundings as Arthur let&#x27;s out a humourous breath, rolling his eyes for a ground-breaking time that day. Giaus had made sure Merlin was prepared. The trip was expected to take weeks, at most, with how deadly the ominous the beings hold themselves to be. Arthur had implied heavily that Merlin should remain safe, and at home, for the second time every since they have known eachother. The first, of course, being the genocide of Kilgarah. As expected, Merlin fought against such advice with a vengeance, and Arthur himself feels guilt to the relief at that. Merlin would be safest in Camelot, he cannot have anything happen to him. Regardless, pride swells inside his chest as he watches the man. Elegant with a nature he has never been able to comprehend. Otherworldly. His eyes are unique to himself, his cheekbones striking with a delicate harsh beauty. Arthur, of course, would direct away from such thoughts. He&#x27;ll clench his fists and tightly close his eyes, his breath trapped in the jump of his heart. Merlin is loyal to a fault. His kindness glows from his grins, his careful touch and knighthood mentality. Happy to serve him, Merlin had said, until the day he died. Arthur refused to believe that day would ever come. Perhaps such a fate could have been diverted if he had for once, in the whole of his Royal Arse&#x27;s life, listened to Merlin&#x27;s funny feelings. Of course, he hadn&#x27;t. Merlin had no time to point to the prince and haughtily laugh because he was right! He was right, he is always right! No time at all. The shadows caved in, swarming them all in bloodshed and defense, tall, lean, dark, with pointed flesh with razor jaws. Gwaine jumped down, clasping the hilt of his sword and swinging with all the might within him, though no mortal blade would pierce hatred incarnate. Percival, ever so silent, cries out Gwaine&#x27;s name, his throat imidentially scratching with rawness. He, too, swung and swung. Leon sliced and dashed, Lancelot had ducked and slashed. Arthur swirled the blade within his hand, Excalibur seeming to be their salvation. Slithers of shimmering, translucent darkness fractured to the threat of Arthur&#x27;s sword. Dragon&#x27;s breath was enough to impale the surrounding screeching succubus, thrashing violently. His men are not mortally wounded, he himself finds his breaths audible and catching as he stumbles uncoordinated. &quot;Is everyone alright?!&quot; Arthur declared in a sick desperation, clinging to his sword. His men shouted back, quickly joining Arthur&#x27;s side. &quot;What&#x27;d I say, ay?&quot; Gwaine laughs out from his right, ever the drunken optimist. &quot;Merlin called it first! He called it, and he was /right/, why don&#x27;t you knight him? The thing I like about Merlin is he never does take any credit-&quot; Gwaine&#x27;s breathless loved chatter faded to Arthur&#x27;s ringing ears, his eyes searching. Searching. They&#x27;re gone, the Darkling Fae, they&#x27;ve retreated to consort with their Queen, leaving them once again stranded, injured, and breathless. Yet all intact. Well, apart from.. &quot;Merlin?&quot; Arthur whispered, brows furrowed. Any sound from the Knights, from Gwaine, imidentially haulted. This wasn&#x27;t supposed to happen. Nothing ever happens to Merlin, ever, he is the thorn in Arthur&#x27;s backside. The constant! The harmless, painless, joyful, constant who escapes unscratched no matter the consequences, no matter the situation. &quot;Merlin!&quot; Yells out, a fury in his words. An instruction to return to his prince, to return /home/. &quot;Merlin, mate, where are ya?!&quot; Gwaine joined in, and then Lancelot, followed by all the Knights. It was humourous to the chattering rocks around them, watching the warriors cluck like chickens. It wasn&#x27;t funny to Arthur, tho, not at all, as he ventured forth with no conscience at all, slicing at swinging vines with his weapon at hand. His breaths are quick and his throat is red with the strain. &quot;This isn&#x27;t funny, you /clotpole/!!&quot; He froze, whipping his head around, begging for him to reappear with &#x27;thats my word, idiot&#x27; upon his smiling lips. All of the man simply stood, stagnantly lost in the tranquility of their fear. Pure, unadulterated fear. Arthur swallowed, it&#x27;s loud to his thundering ear drums splattered a little with the blood that isn&#x27;t his. &quot;They&#x27;re many more useless servants out there, Merlin, don&#x27;t be thinking you&#x27;re a special case- I can just find myself another one!&quot; If the hard words of spite had an underlining tremor, not a single peep of it was mentioned. The ground is drenched in blood and the soil seems to throb as it absorbs it, the blood of the Darkling Fae that hunted them like fresh meat, the blood from Lancelot&#x27;s shallow open gash leaking from his thigh. Down, down, onto the ground, right where a red neckerchief can be found. Then, all at once, time seems to launch upon them. Arthur quickly kneels down by the familiar scarf, clinching it between calloused fingertips, each detail ingraved within the retinas of his mind. &quot;FUCK!&quot; Gwaine exclaimed. &quot;They took Merlin, the bastards TOOK Merlin!&quot; He&#x27;s the first to say it, to materialize it into the reality they now face. He drives his sword into the ground, his booming voice furious. Arthur remained knelt upon his knee, clutching the red cloth, uncertain wether it is red by design or if the sickening stench of iron and pennies painted it to be so. He should have listened, both Merlin and Arthur have sworn a mutual unspoken pact to eachother to fight. Fight for eachother, die for eachother, live for eachother. Only if he just listened, rather than dismissing his fear. Merlin never gets scared, he does not do scared. He doesn&#x27;t do trembling lips and wet eyes, he should have listened yet all he could focus on was diffusing that vulnerability- He&#x27;s gone, he&#x27;s gone he&#x27;s gone he&#x27;s gone he&#x27;s gone, he&#x27;s gone, had he shouted? Had he shouted for help? For Arthur? For someone, anyone? He hadn&#x27;t heard. Prat, unforgivable /PRAT/ the lifeless crystallised eyes of Merlin&#x27;s fate to the Dorocha is all he can see and oh god he&#x27;s gone- he is never gone when he needs him most yet now- because of him. Arthur abruptly rose, clenching the bloodied neckerchief within his hand. Blood. Merlin&#x27;s blood. Because of him. Arthur&#x27;s hands shook. &quot;Onwards.&quot; The single command left measured and assured, the creaking vines watched from underneath damp oak logs with suspension. &quot;I see track marks.&quot; he nodded in the direction of disturbed ground, hovering around it in imitation of a circling snake. The Knights silently climbed their horses, Arthur joining them Infront. Arthur felt life and she roared a storm inside him. End Notes Hello!!!

With Morgana and her son Mordred&#x27;s help, he finds out he&#x27;s single. They meet and fall in love. Notes Thanks to my sister kaseyboy for being my beta again. You&#x27;re the best! This is my first mute Merlin story. Please forgive any errors I&#x27;ve made about muteness and sign language. The movie &#x27;Love Actually&#x27; was the inspiration for one part of the story. If you&#x27;ve seen the movie then you&#x27;ll probably know what I&#x27;m referring to. I hope you enjoy and comments are greatly appreciated. -- -- &quot;Wow! Morgana, do you see him? He&#x27;s so cute!&quot; &quot;Who?&quot; &quot;That guy over there,&quot; Arthur said while trying to discreetly point towards the guy in question. &quot;Wow, you&#x27;re not kidding.&quot; &quot;I wonder if he&#x27;s gay?&quot; &quot;I&#x27;ll go check!&quot; Mordred yelled as he took off towards the guy. &quot;No Mordred, please get back here!&quot; Arthur yelled but it was too late. Mordred was already halfway to the guy. &quot;Hey, are you gay, my uncle wants to know,&quot; he said as he pointed to where Arthur and Morgana were sitting. The cute guy&#x27;s face and ears turned adorably red as he looked in the direction Mordred had pointed. A pretty girl with dark curly hair rushed over from the counter when she heard Mordred&#x27;s question and said, &quot;yes, he&#x27;s gay.&quot; Mordred went running back over to them, &quot;he&#x27;s gay Uncle Arthur.&quot; &quot;I can&#x27;t believe you just did that,&quot; Arthur said as he looked at Mordred before he turned to Morgana and said, &quot;I can&#x27;t believe you let him do that.&quot; Morgana laughed and leaned over to whisper something in her son&#x27;s ear and then, all of a sudden, he took off running back towards the cute guy. &quot;Hey, my uncle wants to know if you&#x27;re single,&quot; and he once again pointed to Arthur who was absolutely mortified. &quot;Yes, he most certainly is,&quot; the dark haired girl once again answered for him with a smile. The cute guy turned to the girl and gave her an &#x27;I can&#x27;t believe you just did that look&#x27; before he put his head down and shook it. If Arthur thought he was mortified before, it didn&#x27;t even compare to how he felt after Mordred turned and yelled, while still standing by the guy, &quot;hey Uncle Arthur, he&#x27;s single!&quot; &quot;I hate you, I really do,&quot; Arthur said to Morgana as his face turned scarlet from embarrassment. &quot;Oh now, don&#x27;t be like that. You know you would&#x27;ve never had the nerve to go over there and ask him yourself.&quot; &quot;That&#x27;s not the point and you know it. Now, even if I wanted to, I couldn&#x27;t go over there and talk to him. He probably thinks I&#x27;m a total loser for sending a kid over to ask him those questions.&quot; &quot;Mordred, come on honey, it&#x27;s time to go,&quot; Morgana called to her son who was still on the other side of the nearly empty coffee shop. When he came over to her, she again bent down and whispered something in his ear which was followed by him dashing back over to the cute guy for the third time. Arthur, upon seeing Mordred running over to the cute guy yet again, quickly stood up and rushed out the door before he heard Mordred tell his mum, &quot;his name&#x27;s Merlin.&quot; ------- Once they were back at Morgana&#x27;s, she asked him, &quot;so, do you want to know what his name is?&quot; &quot;What, you know it?&quot; &quot;That&#x27;s what Mordred ran over for.&quot; &quot;Oh well, it doesn&#x27;t really matter, I&#x27;ll probably never see him again.&quot; &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t be so sure of that,&quot; she said as she smiled back at him. &quot;What&#x27;s with the smile? Do you know something and aren&#x27;t telling me?&quot; &quot;Well, dear little brother, I do recall seeing him at Camelot Coffee a few weeks ago when Leon and I were there. He was with a group of five or six others, I think.&quot; &quot;Well, there&#x27;s no way I could ever face him after today,&quot; he said as he glared at her. &quot;Why not? I&#x27;m sure he was flattered.&quot; Then to try to get him to stop glaring, she added, &quot;in case you&#x27;re interested, his name is Merlin.&quot; Arthur smiled then. &quot;I think it suits him.&quot; &quot;Yeah, me too. Now am I forgiven?&quot; &quot;Not by a long shot. I&#x27;ll talk to you later. Bye Morgs, give Mordred a hug for me.&quot; &quot;Will do,&quot; and she shut the door as Arthur walked back to his car and headed to his own place. -------- The following week, Arthur stopped by the coffee shop every morning before work hoping he&#x27;d see Merlin, but he never did. So the week after that, he stopped by the coffee shop every evening after work but still had no luck in spotting him. By that Friday, Arthur was really discouraged. He&#x27;d had a terrible day and no plans for the weekend and was hoping he&#x27;d see Merlin because he knew that would cheer him up. As he walked in, he did what he had done every day for the past two weeks, he looked around at all the tables before he stepped up to order a coffee and bagel sandwich. While he was waiting on his order, the bell above the door chimed and he instantly turned, in hopes of seeing Merlin walking through the door. No such luck. As the girl who took his order, Freya, according to her name tag, handed him his coffee and sandwich she asked him, &quot;are you looking for someone?&quot; &quot;Um, yeah, I guess.&quot; &quot;Maybe I can help you. I know all the regulars,&quot; she said giving him a friendly smile. &quot;I&#x27;m looking for this guy named Merlin. I saw him in here a few weeks ago.&quot; &quot;I know Merlin. He&#x27;s a real sweetie. You should come back tomorrow afternoon, he&#x27;ll probably be here.&quot; &quot;Great, thank you so much.&quot; &quot;You&#x27;re welcome. Have a nice evening.&quot; &quot;I will, you too.&quot; He then walked out into the chilly October evening feeling both excited and extremely nervous about the prospect of seeing Merlin tomorrow. -------- &quot;Hey Morgs, want to grab a coffee with me tomorrow? I&#x27;ll buy and even let you order a muffin,&quot; Arthur said into the phone. &quot;Let me guess, you&#x27;re hoping to see Merlin, aren&#x27;t you?&quot; &quot;Maybe. There&#x27;s just something about him. I haven&#x27;t been able to get him off my mind.&quot; &quot;Baby brother, I think you may be suffering from love at first sight.&quot; &quot;Don&#x27;t be ridiculous. I&#x27;m not in love with the guy, I just find him incredibly attractive.&quot; &quot;Okay, whatever you say. Leon and Mordred have a scout meeting tomorrow so, as luck would have it, I&#x27;m free. Just pick me up around 1:00.&quot; &quot;Alright, thanks Morgana, I&#x27;ll see you tomorrow.&quot; -------- Arthur showed up at Morgana&#x27;s just after noon. He would have been there earlier but he had a terrible time trying to decide what to wear. He even brought a few different shirts he could try if Morgana didn&#x27;t like what he had on. &quot;Hey Uncle Arthur. I&#x27;ve got a scout meeting and Daddy&#x27;s going to teach us how to tie different kinds of knots,&quot; Mordred rushed out. &quot;Hey there Arthur, how&#x27;s it going?&quot; Leon asked as he walked into the room. &quot;Great, how&#x27;s everything with you?&quot; &quot;I can&#x27;t complain. So I hear there&#x27;s a cute guy you&#x27;re hoping to see today,&quot; Leon said with a grin on his face. &quot;Morgana!&quot; Arthur yelled horrified that she had told Leon, even though he was her husband. Morgana walked into the room, &quot;oh settle down Arthur. It&#x27;s not like Leon is going to tell anyone. You look really good. How long did it take you to figure out what to wear?&quot; &quot;Not long,&quot; he said but he knew his flushed face gave him away. &quot;Well, we&#x27;re off. See you both this evening and have fun,&quot; she said before giving Leon a kiss and squeezing Mordred tight. &quot;You too,&quot; Leon said. As they were walking out the door, Arthur heard Mordred yell, &quot;good luck Uncle Arthur.&quot; Arthur turned to look at Morgana and just shook his head. -------- The coffee house was fairly busy when Arthur and Morgana arrived. Once they found a table, Arthur walked over to the counter to place their order. He tried to discreetly look around to see if Merlin was there but he didn&#x27;t spot him. Freya was once again there to take his order. She looked at him as she grinned and said, &quot;he hasn&#x27;t come in yet, but don&#x27;t worry, he&#x27;ll show up.&quot; &quot;Don&#x27;t you ever get a day off,&quot; he asked her, trying to ignore what she&#x27;d said. &quot;Nope, I own the place so I&#x27;m always here.&quot; &quot;Yeah, I&#x27;ve noticed,&quot; he said and grinned back at her. -------- About thirty minutes later, after Arthur and Morgana had already finished their muffins and were each on their second cup of coffee, the bell over the door chimed. Morgana was seated facing the door and when she broke out in a smile, Arthur knew Merlin had arrived. Arthur tried being coy as he snuck a peak over his shoulder to see Merlin. It just happened that at the same moment, Merlin had looked over and their eyes met. Arthur noticed how Merlin gave him a shy smile as his face and ears started to redden and he bowed his head. He was just as adorable as Arthur remembered him being. When he&#x27;d seen him before, Merlin had been sitting down. Now, standing there, Arthur saw how tall and lean he was. He had a narrow waist and nice broad shoulders. He was with the same girl as before but this time there was also a handsome bloke with them. Arthur&#x27;s heart sank a little thinking maybe that bloke could be his boyfriend now. After all, it&#x27;d been over two weeks ago since Mordred yelled out that Merlin was single. Just thinking about that day still caused him to cringe. It was like Morgana could read his mind because she said, &quot;oh stop it, I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re just friends.&quot; Arthur continued to watch as Merlin and the girl went and sat down while the guy placed their orders with Freya. It was obvious they were regulars because Freya greeted them all with a big smile and addressed them by name, Lance and Gwen. -------- About five minutes after they had arrived, the dark haired girl, Gwen, got up to go to the bathroom. A minute later Morgana got up without saying a word to Arthur. He had seen Gwen head towards the bathroom so when Morgana stood and headed in the same direction, he panicked. &quot;Morgana, wait, what do you think you&#x27;re doing? Get back here.&quot; She ignored him, of course, and went into the restroom with Gwen. Once inside, Morgana introduced herself. Gwen smiled and said, &quot;hi, I&#x27;m Gwen. I remember you from a few weeks ago. Was it your son that asked about Merlin?&quot; &quot;Yes, that was Mordred.&quot; &quot;He&#x27;s so cute.&quot; &quot;Thank you. Can I ask you something?&quot; &quot;Sure, go ahead.&quot; &quot;Well, my brother, Arthur, is quite attracted to Merlin. Is he single?&quot; &quot;Yeah, he is, but he&#x27;s really shy.&quot; &quot;We&#x27;ve noticed.&quot; &quot;I guess I should tell you Merlin is mute.&quot; Morgana&#x27;s surprise must have been obvious because Gwen told her, &quot;it&#x27;s okay, he has been since birth. Merlin has been hurt a lot by people turning their backs on him once they find out, so you can tell your brother. If he won&#x27;t be able to handle that, it&#x27;d be best if he just not even bother.&quot; &quot;Actually, I&#x27;m pretty sure he&#x27;ll be okay with that.&quot; The two continued talking for a few more minutes. They really got along great, like they&#x27;d known each other for years. Before they left, they exchanged numbers and made plans to get together sometime next week. -------- Morgana returned to their table and told Arthur she was ready to leave so he stood up and followed her outside. &quot;What was that all about?&quot; he wanted to know. &quot;We&#x27;ll talk about it once we get back to my place.&quot; Morgana lived rather close by so they were there within minutes. &quot;Okay, what&#x27;s going on?&quot; Arthur demanded once they were seated in her living room. &quot;Well, I talked to Gwen, Merlin&#x27;s friend. She is so nice, we&#x27;re going to meet up sometime next week...&quot; &quot;Morgana!&quot; Arthur said harshly to get her back on track. &quot;Oh yes, sorry. I found out from her that Merlin is mute,&quot; she said with a sadness in her voice. &quot;Oh, what exactly does that mean?&quot; He knew what it meant to be mute but he was just trying to figure out how to deal with this shocking news. &quot;Gwen said that Merlin uses sign language to communicate. Her and all his other friends can read sign.&quot; &quot;Well, okay, I didn&#x27;t see that one coming, but that&#x27;s okay, I can learn sign language too.&quot; &quot;Wow, you really have it bad for him don&#x27;t you?&quot; she said with a smile. &quot;Yeah Morgs, I do.&quot; -------- Arthur had to go out of town unexpectedly for work a few days later so he hadn&#x27;t had a chance to figure out how he was going to go about getting a date with Merlin. When he returned at the end of the week, Morgana walked into his office. &quot;We need to talk about Merlin.&quot; &quot;What is it?&quot; he asked her concerned. &quot;Look, Gwen and I went out to lunch a couple of times this week. Anyway, she said that Merlin is extremely shy and quite tentative about going out with anyone.&quot; &quot;So are you trying to tell me I should give up...&quot; &quot;No, just listen to me. Merlin never had a boyfriend until his third year of uni. Gwen and him grew up together. She said people always avoided him because of him being mute. Then in uni, this guy Cendred, started paying attention to him and asked him out. They went out for a few weeks until,&quot; Morgana became very quiet and put her head down for a minute. &quot;What Morgana, until what?&quot; He was afraid of what she might say. &quot;Cendred was only using Merlin. Merlin overheard him one day telling his friends that it was going to be so much fun making him cry and silently scream out in pain but not being able to yell out for help.&quot; Arthur went instantly pale. The thought of someone wanting to do something like that to Merlin made him sick. Even though he didn&#x27;t know Merlin, he knew that he wanted to protect him always and keep him safe. Morgana saw the anger on Arthur&#x27;s face and the tears that threatened to fall from his eyes and said, &quot;listen Arthur, if you are really interested in Merlin,&quot; and here Arthur just gave her a look, &quot;okay, sorry, I know you&#x27;re really interested in him, but you&#x27;re going to have to take it slow and be patient with him. He&#x27;s never dated anyone else.&quot; &quot;I am more than willing to take it slow. I think he&#x27;s going to be worth it.&quot; &quot;I can&#x27;t believe it, my little brother is in love,&quot; she gushed. &quot;Oh just shut it. Now I have work to do so if you&#x27;ll please leave my office...&quot; &quot;Okay, but one more thing. Gwen and Lance are having a cook-out in the park tomorrow. It&#x27;s not going to be very big but Leon and I are invited and she asked me to bring you along too so you and Merlin could actually meet, that is, if you&#x27;re interested.&quot; &quot;Haha, very funny. What time?&quot; &quot;She said around 2:00. Why don&#x27;t you come over to our place and then you can go with Leon and me.&quot; &quot;What about Mordred?&quot; &quot;He&#x27;s going to be spending the day with Uther.&quot; &quot;Okay. Hey Morgana, thanks,&quot; he said sincerely. &quot;You are quite welcome. See you tomorrow. Now get back to work,&quot; she said as she walked out of his office. -------- Saturday, Arthur arrived at Morgana&#x27;s just after 1:00 a nervous wreck. &quot;Take a deep breath and just relax Arthur. Everything&#x27;s going to be fine,&quot; Morgana tried to reassure him. &quot;But how am I supposed to talk to him?&quot; &quot;Just talk to him like you&#x27;d talk to anyone else. Remember, he&#x27;s not deaf. Gwen told me that Merlin uses his phone to type out what he wants to say to people who don&#x27;t read sign, so everything&#x27;s going to be fine.&quot; -------- Less than an hour later, Morgana, Leon and Arthur were at the park walking towards Gwen, who rushed over and hugged Morgana. &quot;Gwen, I&#x27;d like to introduce you to Leon, my husband, and this is Arthur,&quot; she said. After she greeted them both, she led them over to the rest of the people gathered there. She introduced them to Lance, her fiance, Percy and his girlfriend Mithian, Gwaine and his girlfriend Elena and last of all Merlin. They were all very friendly and made them feel welcome. Before Arthur had a chance to go talk to Merlin, Gwaine put him in a neck hold and said, &quot;come on Merlin, we&#x27;re going to go play some frisbee.&quot; He then yelled for Lance and Percy to join them. Before they walked away, Gwaine turned to Leon and Arthur, &quot;come on you two, want to join us?&quot; &quot;Maybe in a little while,&quot; Arthur said. Leon declined because he&#x27;d been having problems with his shoulder ever since he fell in a friendly game of rugby. -------- Arthur tried to watch as the four men threw the frisbee around but he couldn&#x27;t tear his eyes away from Merlin. He looked so happy and carefree, smiling and laughing silently. Arthur couldn&#x27;t help but notice that Merlin&#x27;s jeans slipped lower on his hips with every throw and catch he made until he&#x27;d finally pull them up a little. He also noticed the well defined muscles in his back and arms. He almost fell over when Merlin pulled the bottom of his shirt up to wipe the sweat off his face thus exposing his stomach. Arthur took a big gulp as he stared. Merlin had a nice flat stomach that had fine dark hair leading from his navel downward. His jeans hung low on his hips exposing the waistband and the top part of his boxer briefs, which caused Arthur to laugh. A few minutes later, Lance ran over to him and said, &quot;I need a break plus I have to start the grill. Why don&#x27;t you go play?&quot; Arthur said, &quot;okay, thanks,&quot; and walked over to where the other three were. He had more fun than he&#x27;d had in a long time. Finally, Gwen called everyone over when Lance was finished with grilling the hotdogs and hamburgers. Arthur hung back with Merlin as they walked over to the others. He was in a panic trying to think of something to say so he finally spit out, &quot;I like your boxers.&quot; This caused Merlin to blush before he gave Arthur a questioning look. &quot;Your boxers, I saw them when you were playing frisbee.&quot; Merlin pulled up his shirt so he could see what Arthur was referring too. As soon as he saw the smiley face boxers he was wearing, his face and ears turned even redder. &quot;They&#x27;re really cute, like you,&quot; he added. Merlin signed something Arthur assumed meant &#x27;thank you.&#x27; -------- They got their food and drinks and Merlin went and sat down on one of the many blankets Gwen had spread out for the group. Arthur nervously walked over to him and said, &quot;can I join you?&quot; When Merlin nodded, Arthur thanked him and sat down. Arthur talked to Merlin, making sure to ask him questions he could answer with a yes or no until they were both finished eating and Merlin had his hands free to type if he wanted to. &quot;what do you do?&quot; Merlin typed into his phone and showed Arthur. &quot;I work for my father&#x27;s real estate development company.&quot; &quot;do you like it?&quot; Merlin again typed. &quot;Yeah, I do. I guess I always just grew up knowing that&#x27;s what I&#x27;d do when I grew up. How about you, what do you do?&quot; Merlin typed, &quot;i work as an editor at a publishing house.&quot; &quot;Do you like it?&quot; Arthur grinned as he asked him. &quot;yeah i do. i always wanted to write a novel but i guess i settled for reading them instead.&quot; &quot;Why?&quot; &quot;no one would be interested in what i have to say,&quot; he typed and showed it to arthur with downturned lips. &quot;I&#x27;d be interested,&quot; Arthur told him with such sincerity it made Merlin blush. They continued talking this way while Gwen and Morgana watched them and just smiled knowing they were witnessing the start of something life changing for each boy. Before the group broke up for the afternoon, Arthur asked Merlin for his number which he gave him without any hesitation at all. As Merlin started to walk away, Arthur yelled for him to wait and ran up to him. &quot;Will you go out to dinner with me sometime?&quot; Merlin blushed and nodded his head. &quot;Great! I&#x27;ll text you. Bye Merlin, see you soon.&quot; He turned around and walked back over to Leon and Morgana, who were unable to hide the smiles on their faces. &quot;I do believe our Arthur is in love,&quot; Morgana said to Leon trying to tease Arthur. Arthur just smiled at her and said, &quot;yes, I think you&#x27;re right.&quot; -------- Arthur texted Merlin that night and they continued texting throughout the week. They made plans to go to a movie and then dinner on Saturday. Arthur offered to pick Merlin up but Merlin insisted he&#x27;d take the tube. Arthur already felt so protective of Merlin, he didn&#x27;t like the idea but agreed nonetheless. Arthur was worried sick when Merlin finally showed up twenty minutes late. As soon as he saw Merlin he instantly questioned him, &quot;are you okay? Did something happen?&quot; Merlin just smiled and shook his head before he pulled out his phone and typed, &quot;sorry i&#x27;m late. i was helping a lady catch her dog.&quot; Arthur read it, looked at him and grinned. &quot;Well, how could I be upset with you over that.&quot; He couldn&#x27;t help himself as he reached out and grabbed Merlin&#x27;s hand and held onto it as they went into the theatre to watch a movie. After the movie, throughout which Arthur kept ahold of Merlin&#x27;s hand, Arthur asked him if he had any preference about dinner. When Merlin shook his head no, Arthur asked if Chinese would be okay. Merlin nodded so Arthur once again took his hand and they walked the three blocks to the restaurant. -------- After they were done eating Arthur insisted he drive Merlin home which Merlin allowed. Once they were standing outside Merlin&#x27;s door, Arthur told him, &quot;I had a really nice time. Can I see you again.&quot; Merlin smiled at him and nodded his head. Arthur looked him in the eyes as he asked, &quot;can I kiss you now?&quot; Merlin&#x27;s cheeks turned pink as he nodded again. Arthur brought his hands up to cradle Merlin&#x27;s face as he leaned in and gave him a sweet kiss. He pulled back a few short seconds later and as he gently brushed his thumbs over Merlin&#x27;s cheekbones he said, &quot;Merlin, I&#x27;m falling for you.&quot; He then leaned back into Merlin and gave him another kiss. He wanted to keep kissing him but he remembered what Morgana told him about taking it slow with Merlin and the last thing he wanted to do was scare him away or make him feel pressured so he reluctantly pulled back. &quot;I&#x27;d better get going. I&#x27;ll see you soon.&quot; When Merlin smiled and nodded Arthur just had to lean back in and kiss that gorgeous mouth one last time before he said, &quot;I&#x27;ll text you.&quot; He waited until Merlin was safely in his flat before he turned and walked away feeling happier than he&#x27;s ever felt in his life. -------- Arthur texted him once he got home. He asked him if he had plans for tomorrow. When Merlin texted back that he was going to visit his mum, Arthur&#x27;s heart sank in disappointment. They made plans to go on another date next Saturday. -------- Things were going great with Arthur and Merlin. They&#x27;d been dating nearly two months. Arthur had secretly hired a tutor to teach him sign language so it was getting easier for them to carry on a conversation. By learning to read signs, he hoped to show Merlin how much he meant to him and how serious he was about their relationship. -------- Arthur, Morgana and Leon along with Merlin and his friends Gwen, Lance, Gwaine, Elena, Percy and Mithian soon became one happy group. Merlin&#x27;s friends were all thrilled to see that the three new additions to their group were all learning sign language. &quot;He deserves to be happy and you obviously make him happy so thank you,&quot; Elena told Arthur one evening while they were all gathered at the pub. Merlin left to go use the loo when some guy stopped him by grabbing his arm. Merlin tried to pull away but the guy, who was much larger than Merlin, pulled him closer. All of a sudden the guy let go of Merlin and was looking at a very angry Arthur. &quot;Don&#x27;t you ever touch him again,&quot; Arthur growled as he led Merlin into the loo. &quot;Are you okay? Did he hurt you?&quot; Merlin shook his head and signed &quot;thank you&quot; to Arthur. &quot;You&#x27;re welcome,&quot; he told him as he pulled him in for a hug and sweet kiss. Unbeknownst to Arthur, everyone at their table had witnessed what he had done for Merlin and knew Merlin was safe and in good hands. -------- Arthur and Merlin had been dating for five months. They were at Arthur&#x27;s flat where he was cooking them dinner. After they ate and cleaned up, they went into the living room to watch a movie. Arthur was sitting leaning against the arm of the sofa while Merlin was sitting between his legs with his back against Arthur&#x27;s chest and his head resting on Arthur&#x27;s shoulder. Arthur thought Merlin had drifted off as he rubbed his nose in Merlin&#x27;s hair giving him kisses and whispered, &quot;I love you so much.&quot; Merlin instantly tensed up,meaning he hadn&#x27;t been asleep after all. As Merlin leaned up off Arthur, he put his head down. &quot;Merlin what is it?&quot; Merlin loved Arthur but he had trouble believing anyone, especially someone like Arthur, would or could ever love him. After all, he was just the mute guy that most people avoided so how could it be possible Arthur would love him. &quot;I just remembered there was something I had to do,&quot; he signed as he stood and rushed to the door. By now, Arthur was much better at reading Merlin&#x27;s signs so he knew he was saying that as a way to make his escape. Arthur was devastated but still managed to ask Merlin to please take a taxi home and not the tube. Merlin nodded and walked out the door. Arthur fell back on the sofa and let the tears fall. What had just happened? He told Merlin he loved him and Merlin took off. Maybe he had it wrong, maybe Merlin wasn&#x27;t as serious about him as he was about Merlin or maybe Merlin wasn&#x27;t interested in any kind of long term relationship. He texted Merlin half an hour later to make sure he made it home safely. &quot;yes,&quot; was all he got back. Arthur drug himself to bed feeling hurt, lost and confused. He finally fell into a restless sleep several hours later. -------- The next day, Arthur didn&#x27;t text Merlin because he didn&#x27;t want to feel like he was pressuring him. He thought it&#x27;d be best if he just gave Merlin some time to think about things before he texted him again. Around 8:00 that evening, his doorbell rang. Arthur opened it to see Merlin standing there holding poster boards. He looked directly at Arthur as he dropped the first poster board that was blank to reveal one with writing. It read: &quot;I&#x27;m sorry I ran away like that.&quot; He then dropped that one to reveal the next: &quot;I guess I just got scared.&quot; That was followed by: &quot;I don&#x27;t think I love you.&quot; Arthur put his head down and tried to fight the tears when he read that. He heard Merlin stomp his foot on the floor so he looked back up. Merlin waved the sign in from of him again: &quot;I don&#x27;t think I love you.&quot; &quot;Okay, I get it Merlin,&quot; Arthur said aggravated that Merlin wanted to point that out again. Merlin just shook his head and dropped that sign to reveal the next which said: &quot;I KNOW I love you&quot; Arthur was shocked and looked him in the eyes and saw the love there but before he could say anything, Merlin dropped that sign and showed him the last one: &quot;You can kiss me now&quot; Merlin then dropped his sign and Arthur didn&#x27;t hesitate as he stepped forward and wrapped Merlin in his arms before he kissed him passionately. Arthur pulled away and led Merlin inside. He then told him, &quot;Merlin, I love you so much. Please don&#x27;t ever doubt that.&quot; Merlin signed, &quot;I&#x27;m so sorry. It&#x27;s just hard for me to believe that someone like you could ever love me.&quot; Arthur was able to read every word. &quot;Well you better believe it cause that&#x27;s never going to change.&quot; He then pulled Merlin back in and crushed their lips together and kissed him longingly. -------- Arthur and Merlin took it slow. When they finally spent their first night together it was magical. It was Merlin&#x27;s first time and Arthur wished, more than anything, that he&#x27;d saved himself for Merlin. He couldn&#x27;t change that now but he knew he&#x27;d never be with anyone else ever again because Merlin was it for him. -------- A year to the day since Arthur saw Merlin for the first time, he took him to the coffee shop where they met Gwen who was already sitting at the exact table they were at that fateful day. Merlin didn&#x27;t notice when Morgana and Mordred entered and went and sat at the same exact table they&#x27;d been at. Leon, Lance, Percy, Elena, Gwaine and Mithian were all in the back behind the counter peeking out every so often. Arthur stood up and excused himself. He told Merlin he was going to the loo but Gwen already knew his plans. Less than a minute after Arthur left, Mordred came over and said, &quot;hey Merlin, will you marry him, my Uncle Arthur wants to know,&quot; and he pointed over towards Arthur. Merlin was shocked. He looked at Mordred for a minute before he followed where he was pointing and saw Arthur sitting at a table across the coffee shop. When Merlin looked over at him, Arthur stood up and then got down on one knee and was holding a small box. Merlin nodded and Gwen quickly added yes. &quot;Hey Uncle Arthur, he said yes,&quot; Mordred yelled across from where he was still standing by Merlin. Arthur rushed over to Merlin as Morgana and Gwen got up from their tables and the rest of their friends came running out from behind the counter to congratulate the happy couple. Arthur and Merlin were so lost in each other that it took them a while to notice that they&#x27;d been surrounded by their friends. Neither had ever been so happy and knew that as long as they had each other, they&#x27;d always be happy.

What happens when Merlin finds out that the man he&#x27;s having dinner with is bad for business? (This is Part II to: New In Town ) Notes READ PART ONE: NEW IN TOWN Merlin took a sip of his wine and looked up at the man that sat across from him. On the outside, Arthur was the perfect specimen: broad shoulders, strong hands, devilishly gorgeous blue eyes that Merlin could get lost in for hours. But, why was this man single? Why was he eating alone at a restaurant on New Year’s Eve? Didn’t he have friends or a party to go to? Merlin was only there to get some takeaway and his plan was to veg out on the sofa and watch Telly, get drunk or just read a book or something. He was new in town and didn’t have any friends yet. He just could not understand why Arthur would be there alone. “I know what you’re doing,” Arthur said as he placed his glass of wine on the table and peered down at Merlin. “Oh? What am I doing?” Merlin asked, nearly challenging him. “You’re trying to figure me out, or, scrutinise me or something. I know that look.” Merlin scowled. “What look?” “That look that says I have you all figured out, Arthur Pendragon .” Merlin laughed. “That wasn’t the look, especially since I didn’t even know your full name until now.” Pendragon . Brilliant. Merlin worked as a programmer for Le Faye Designs: the sole competition of Pendragon Works in Camelot. He was having dinner with the enemy. On New Year’s Eve. “Now you do. It only seems fair that I should know yours.” “I—” need to get the fuck out of here . Merlin closed his mouth as no words came out. He tried to speak again but the waitress had arrived with their order. She smiled and Arthur and completely ignored Merlin. Merlin couldn’t help it and snorted. “What is it?” Arthur asked, looking confused. “What is what? My full name?” Merlin asked, an eyebrow raised. He picked up his wine glass again and took a very large sip. “No. Yes. I mean that , too. But that reaction you just had—what was that ?” “The ladies…” Merlin waived his hands in the air motioning towards the servers and the hostess, “…they know that you’re gay, don’t they?” “Well, I didn’t publicise it in The Camelot Gazette , but yeah, it’s common knowledge. Especially after my big break up about three years ago—which did make it into the Gazette .” He looked at Merlin who was still shaking his head. “So what of it?” “Do they not believe it, or are they treated it like it’s some urban legend?” “You mean the way they act—” Arthur sighed and picked up his fork and knife and started to cut into this sandwich. “My father likes to tell people that it’s just a phase so I think that maybe some women think that it is, even though…well it’s not a phase.” Merlin nodded. He concentrated on his food for the next few minutes: taking big bites and gulping it down with the wine. He needed to get the hell out of there. This was all wrong. All very very wrong. “What’s the matter?” Arthur asked, looking at Merlin in utter disbelief. “I thought we were having a good time? Have I offended you? Do you want me to call the waitress if you need something…” “No. It’s fine,” Merlin said, shaking his head, his mouth half full of turkey. “I just remembered I have to go so I’m just trying to—” act like a complete arse . Arthur nodded. He looked disappointed but didn’t say anything. He looked down at his sandwich and took a big bit of it, as well. “Emrys,” Merlin said finally. “What?” Arthur looked up at him, his blue eyes vibrant. “That’s my name. Merlin Emrys.” “Interesting,” Arthur said. “When you asked about me…around town, I mean…” Merlin paused for a brief second. “Did you find out what I was doing here?” Arthur shook his head. “No, I tried to keep it very subtle. I was afraid that if I asked too much, eventually, someone was going to tell my father and we can’t have that.” Merlin nodded. He picked up his glass of wine and realised that it was empty. Arthur quickly grabbed the bottle and started to refill it for him. It probably wasn’t a good idea to drink that fast, but the waitress hadn’t returned to their table and Merlin didn’t get a chance to ask for more water. “Listen…” Arthur said, almost whispering. Merlin looked up at him, almost afraid of what he was going to say. Afraid that Arthur already knew. “My friends are having a party tonight. Do you think you’d want to…maybe…go?” “I—” Merlin hesitated. “If you have other plans, or a date, or something…” Arthur frowned for a moment then his face was impassive again. “You could bring…him.” “I don’t have a date. Or any other plans, actually. But—” “But?” Arthur said. “Le Faye Designs…” Merlin said and waited for that to sink in for a minute. “Morgana’s company?” Arthur asked. Morgana Le Faye was CEO of Le Faye Designs. She was Merlin’s boss. “I am the new lead programmer for Le Faye Designs,” Merlin said. Surely now that Arthur knew that Merlin worked for the competition, he’d have no interest in taking Merlin to that party. Must to Merlin’s surprise, Arthur laughed. He genuinely laughed like what Merlin had said didn’t matter at all. As if he’d just told him a joke. He glowered at Arthur, feeling offended. Le Faye Designs was a well-established company and last year Morgana was named as top ten female CEOs in the UK. How dare Arthur insult him like that. “What is so funny?” Merlin asked. “I told you my name is Arthur Pendragon so you immediately associated me with Pendragon Works?” Arthur asked and Merlin nodded. “And Le Faye Designs is our competition.” “Yes.” Merlin continued to glower. “You think that since you work for the competition, that I won’t want to take you to the party?” Arthur smirked. Merlin was wrong. The man wasn’t charming and he really had wasted his time trying to imagine him naked. Arthur was a prat. A rich, spoiled prat who was just annoying and frustrating and…still quite hot. Sadly. Arthur eventually calmed down from his roaring laughter and schooled his expression again. “Morgana is my sister. Well half-sister,” he said and now he waited so Merlin could let that sink in. His shock must have been obvious because Arthur smiled. That devilish smile that he’d displayed over the course of their meal. “I think she’ll only find it entertaining that the heir of Pendragon Works is dating someone that works for her company. My father won’t approve of it, of course, so she’ll eat it up. Support the relationship all the way.” “We’re not dating,” Merlin said quickly. “Well, I’d like to date you,” Arthur answered. “You don’t even know me,” Merlin replied, still trying to scowl, but failing miserably. He could feel his ears getting hot. “Okay, so come to the party with me. Let me get to know you.”</span> <a href="#" class="summary-toggle">[ + ]</a></div><div class="stats"><div class="stat-item"><strong>Rating:</strong> Teen And Up Audiences</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Archive Warning:</strong> No Archive Warnings Apply</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Category:</strong> M/M</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Fandom:</strong> Merlin (TV)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Relationship:</strong> Merlin/Arthur Pendragon, Merlin/Arthur Pendragon (Merlin) Series: Part 2 of New In Town Collections: Camelot Drabble -- Prompt #130: Devilish Stats: Published: 2014-10-15 Words: 1180 Bad For Business by digthewriter Summary Merlin&#x27;s just met Arthur, but he can&#x27;t deny his attraction. What happens when Merlin finds out that the man he&#x27;s having dinner with is bad for business? (This is Part II to: New In Town ) Notes READ PART ONE: NEW IN TOWN Merlin took a sip of his wine and looked up at the man that sat across from him. On the outside, Arthur was the perfect specimen: broad shoulders, strong hands, devilishly gorgeous blue eyes that Merlin could get lost in for hours. But, why was this man single? Why was he eating alone at a restaurant on New Year’s Eve? Didn’t he have friends or a party to go to? Merlin was only there to get some takeaway and his plan was to veg out on the sofa and watch Telly, get drunk or just read a book or something. He was new in town and didn’t have any friends yet. He just could not understand why Arthur would be there alone. “I know what you’re doing, ” Arthur said as he placed his glass of wine on the table and peered down at Merlin. “Oh? What am I doing?” Merlin asked, nearly challenging him. “You’re trying to figure me out, or, scrutinise me or something. I know that look.” Merlin scowled. “What look?” “That look that says I have you all figured out, Arthur Pendragon .” Merlin laughed. “That wasn’t the look, especially since I didn’t even know your full name until now.” Pendragon . Brilliant. Merlin worked as a programmer for Le Faye Designs: the sole competition of Pendragon Works in Camelot. He was having dinner with the enemy. On New Year’s Eve. “Now you do. It only seems fair that I should know yours.” “I—” need to get the fuck out of here . Merlin closed his mouth as no words came out. He tried to speak again but the waitress had arrived with their order. She smiled and Arthur and completely ignored Merlin. Merlin couldn’t help it and snorted. “What is it?” Arthur asked, looking confused. “What is what? My full name?” Merlin asked, an eyebrow raised. He picked up his wine glass again and took a very large sip. “No. Yes. I mean that, too. But that reaction you just had—what was that ?” “The ladies…” Merlin waived his hands in the air motioning towards the servers and the hostess, “…they know that you’re gay, don’t they?” “Well, I didn’t publicise it in The Camelot Gazette, but yeah, it’s common knowledge. Especially after my big break up about three years ago—which did make it into the Gazette .” He looked at Merlin who was still shaking his head. “So what of it?” “Do they not believe it, or are they treated it like it’s some urban legend?” “You mean the way they act—” Arthur sighed and picked up his fork and knife and started to cut into this sandwich. “My father likes to tell people that it’s just a phase so I think that maybe some women think that it is, even though…well it’s not a phase.” Merlin nodded. He concentrated on his food for the next few minutes: taking big bites and gulping it down with the wine. He needed to get the hell out of there. This was all wrong. All very very wrong. “What’s the matter?” Arthur asked, looking at Merlin in utter disbelief. “I thought we were having a good time? Have I offended you? Do you want me to call the waitress if you need something…” “No. It’s fine, ” Merlin said, shaking his head, his mouth half full of turkey. “I just remembered I have to go so I’m just trying to—” act like a complete arse . Arthur nodded. He looked disappointed but didn’t say anything. He looked down at his sandwich and took a big bit of it, as well. “Emrys, ” Merlin said finally. “What?” Arthur looked up at him, his blue eyes vibrant. “That’s my name. Merlin Emrys.” “Interesting, ” Arthur said. “When you asked about me…around town, I mean…” Merlin paused for a brief second. “Did you find out what I was doing here?” Arthur shook his head. “No, I tried to keep it very subtle. I was afraid that if I asked too much, eventually, someone was going to tell my father and we can’t have that.” Merlin nodded. He picked up his glass of wine and realised that it was empty. Arthur quickly grabbed the bottle and started to refill it for him. It probably wasn’t a good idea to drink that fast, but the waitress hadn’t returned to their table and Merlin didn’t get a chance to ask for more water.</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Series:</strong> Part 2 of New In Town</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Collections:</strong> Camelot Drabble -- Prompt #130: Devilish</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Published:</strong> 2014-10-15</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Words:</strong> 1180</div></div></div><div class="work-entry"><h2 class="title"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://download.archiveofourown.org/downloads/3581517/Because%20of%20You.pdf?updated_at=1437364230" target="_blank">Because of You</a></h2><div class="summary"><span class="summary-short">Arthur really messed up.

Now, can he ever get Merlin to forgive him? Notes This is the first story I&#x27;ve posted here in over a year and I once again made Merlin deaf. I think I have an obsession. Please forgive any errors I&#x27;ve made about deafness and sign language and any liberties I&#x27;ve taken with head injuries. Thanks yet again to my wonderful sister and beta kaseyboy for all your help. You&#x27;re the best! --- --- Arthur had recently moved back to London. He&#x27;d been living abroad for the last couple of years and was now back to stay. Arthur&#x27;s sister, Morgana, and Leon, her husband and Arthur&#x27;s best friend, were going out to dinner with their friends and talked him into joining them so they could introduce him to everyone. They both knew that he&#x27;d fit right in with their group. While they were sitting around the table waiting for Merlin to arrive, Morgana introduced Arthur to her friends. There was Gwen and Lance, who he instantly liked along with Percy, who seemed like a gentle giant, and Gwaine who, he could already tell, was a big flirt who liked his drink but seemed like a good guy. Morgana told Arthur, &quot;I promise, once you see his smile, you&#x27;ll fall in love with him,&quot; referring to Merlin. Over a year ago, Morgana had started telling him about her new friend Merlin, who she thought would be perfect for Arthur. The only problem was that Merlin was deaf but both she and Leon had learned sign language to make it easier to communicate with him. Everyone at the table knew sign language so Arthur was the odd man out with regards to that. Finally, a tall lean guy with the most beautiful eyes and lips Arthur&#x27;s ever seen walked in and smiled in their direction. &quot;There&#x27;s Merlin,&quot; Morgana told her brother. &quot;Damn, you weren&#x27;t kidding,&quot; he said referring to her comment about falling in love with Merlin once he saw his smile. Merlin and Arthur were instantly attracted to each other. They couldn&#x27;t seem to take their eyes off the other all night. Communicating was a little difficult but thankfully Morgana interpreted for him. The next morning, Arthur hired the same tutor Morgana had used to learn sign language. -------- The two soon started dating and Arthur knew he was in love with Merlin from the beginning. After about six months, they exchanged keys to each other&#x27;s flats. Merlin now kept several changes of clothing at Arthur&#x27;s flat and Arthur kept clothes at Merlin&#x27;s. They soon were spending most of their nights together, alternating between their two flats. Arthur asked Merlin to move in with him after they&#x27;d been dating almost a year but Merlin was hesitant to give up his flat. He secretly feared that Arthur would open his eyes and see he could do better than him and when that time came, he didn&#x27;t want to end up with no home to go back to. Arthur never treated Merlin like he wasn&#x27;t in it for the long-term. He adored Merlin and everyone could see how in love they were but Merlin still hadn&#x27;t gotten past his insecurities regarding their relationship. -------- Almost every Friday the gang would get together and go out to dinner or to a club. One Wednesday, Merlin told Arthur that Will, an old friend from back home, was coming to London for the weekend for his birthday. Gwen and Gwaine, both having grown up with Merlin, were also friends with Will so Gwen thought it&#x27;d be nice if just the four childhood friends went out to celebrate Will&#x27;s birthday on Friday. Arthur was fine with that, telling him to have fun and that he&#x27;d see him on Saturday. -------- Owen, one of Arthur&#x27;s friends, had asked Arthur if he wanted to go out on Friday since he knew Merlin had other plans. &quot;Sure, why not?&quot; Arthur told him. -------- Arthur and Owen had been at the club for a short time when Owen went to dance. Arthur was sitting at a table off to the side when he saw Merlin with his arms around a pretty petite dark-haired girl. He was smiling brightly as he was swinging her in his arms. &quot;How could he...how dare he!&quot; Arthur thought to himself. Sadly, this wasn&#x27;t the first time Arthur had been in this situation. His last boyfriend, Cendred, had cheated on him. It hurt but it was nothing compared to the hurt and anger he felt at this moment. He loved Merlin with all his heart and thought they had a future. He quickly stood up and went to the other side of the club where his two-timing boyfriend and friends wouldn&#x27;t see him. A few minutes later he watched as Merlin walked out with his arm around the girl&#x27;s shoulders followed by Gwen and another guy he&#x27;d never seen before but assumed was Will. He had no idea what happened to Gwaine. Arthur was furious with not only Merlin but with Gwaine and Gwen too. He&#x27;d come to think of them as friends but, obviously, they were only Merlin&#x27;s friends if they were keeping Merlin&#x27;s dirty little secret from him. Arthur moved over to the bar where he sat fuming. After his third drink, a blond man approached him and asked him to dance. Soon they were grinding on the dance floor and then the other man pulled him over to a darkened corner where they started to kiss and it didn&#x27;t take long before Arthur had his hands on the other man&#x27;s arse grinding their groins together as they shared open mouthed kisses. &quot;What the fuck?!&quot; Arthur heard someone yell before the stranger was pulled away from him. When Arthur saw that it was Gwaine, he just glared at him. &quot;What the fuck do you think you&#x27;re doing you fucking bastard?!&quot; Gwaine yelled as he got right in Arthur&#x27;s face. This caused the other bloke to leave. &quot;Fuck off!&quot; Arthur yelled back. &quot;How could you do this to Merlin?!&quot; &quot;Turnabout is fair play,&quot; he sneered. &quot;What the fuck is that supposed to mean?!&quot; &quot;I saw him with that girl!&quot; &quot;Who? Freya?&quot; Gwaine asked, totally confused by what Arthur was saying. &quot;I don&#x27;t know who she was and I don&#x27;t give a fuck! If he thinks he can screw around with some girl behind my back...&quot; &quot;You are a stupid fucking prick! The girl you saw him with is Freya, who&#x27;s like a little sister to him. Will and her just got engaged and he was congratulating them.&quot; Gwaine wanted to punch Arthur in the face so badly but instead he took a deep breath to try to control himself. &quot;Merlin&#x27;s way too good for you,&quot; he spat as he turned to walk away. &quot;What?! Gwaine, wait!&quot; &quot;What?!&quot; Gwaine turned around and yelled. &quot;Oh God, I screwed up. I thought...I really screwed up. Please don&#x27;t tell Merlin about this,&quot; he begged. &quot;You&#x27;ve got to be fucking kidding me if you think I&#x27;ll let you cheat on him and get away with it. You never deserved him in the first place.&quot; He again turned to leave but Arthur grabbed his arm to stop him. &quot;Please Gwaine, you can&#x27;t...please, I&#x27;m begging you, please don&#x27;t tell Merlin. I love him with all my heart...I was so jealous...I know I screwed up but please don&#x27;t tell him. I can&#x27;t lose him.&quot; Gwaine pulled his arm free of Arthur&#x27;s hold and stared at him for a minute before he finally spoke. &quot;If I ever see you do something like this or if I even suspect it, I will tell him.&quot; &quot;Thank you, I swear this will never happen again.&quot; &quot;It better not,&quot; Gwaine said before he glared at Arthur, gave him a hard shove and walked away. Arthur was so thankful that Gwaine had agreed to keep his secret because he knew Merlin would dump him if he ever found out. ------- &quot;What&#x27;s gotten into you?&quot; Merlin signed as he grinned at his boyfriend. Arthur had been spoiling him rotten the last couple of weeks. &quot;Nothing...I just love you so much and I want to show you,&quot; Arthur signed back with a big smile on his face. He felt so guilty for what he&#x27;d done in the club a few weeks ago that spoiling Merlin was the only thing that helped him deal with his guilt. -------- As they were eating dinner at an Italian restaurant, Merlin got a text. It was actually several pictures that were texted to him. The pictures showed Arthur kissing and groping another man. Merlin instantly felt ill which Arthur noticed. &quot;Merlin, are you feeling okay? You look pale all of a sudden,&quot; Arthur signed when Merlin looked up at him. &quot;No, I don&#x27;t feel very good. I&#x27;m just going to go to the restroom. I&#x27;ll be back in a minute,&quot; he signed with shaking hands. &quot;I&#x27;ll go with you,&quot; signed Arthur. Merlin shook his head no and quickly left the table. -------- After Merlin saw the pictures, he knew he had to get away from Arthur so instead of going to the restroom, he took a detour and left the restaurant. He went straight to Arthur&#x27;s flat to get his clothes. He figured if Arthur even bothered to look for him, he&#x27;d head to Merlin&#x27;s flat first. -------- Meanwhile, after almost ten minutes of waiting for Merlin to return, Arthur was just getting ready to go to the restroom to check on him when Kaye Daniels, a business associate, spotted him and came over and sat down at his table to talk. By the time Kaye had left, another ten minutes had passed. Arthur rushed to the restroom only to find it empty. He quickly pulled out his phone and texted Merlin but got no response. Arthur hurried back over to his table and grabbed both his and Merlin&#x27;s jackets, threw some money down and rushed out to his car. Once inside, he again texted Merlin but got no reply like before. -------- Merlin had just unlocked Arthur&#x27;s door when his phone vibrated. From Arthur: Where are you? Are you okay? He ran to Arthur&#x27;s bedroom and pulled out a duffle bag Arthur kept under his bed and quickly threw his clothes into it. He just stepped into the kitchen when his phone vibrated again. From Arthur: Where are you? Please text me. I&#x27;m worried about you. He opened a drawer, pulled out a pen and paper, scribbled a couple words on it and then took the key to Arthur&#x27;s flat off his key ring and laid it on top. He then rushed outside where he took a taxi to the train station to go back home to Ealdor. -------- Arthur was frantic trying to figure out what happened to Merlin. Since they split their time between their two flats, Arthur decided to check his own place first since it was closer to the restaurant than Merlin&#x27;s. Unfortunately, traffic was terrible because of an accident so, by the time he reached his flat, nearly an hour had passed since he last saw his boyfriend. When he got to his door, he noticed it appeared to be ajar so he cautiously walked in. Seeing no one, he yelled out, &quot;who&#x27;s here?&quot; When he got no response he walked further in. Nothing seemed to be out of place in the sitting room and Merlin wasn&#x27;t there. He rushed into the kitchen and instantly saw a note on the counter. The note said, &quot;good bye&quot; and Merlin&#x27;s key was laying on top of it. &quot;What the fuck?!&quot; He then ran to his bedroom to find the dresser drawers left open and Merlin&#x27;s clothes missing. He found the same thing with his bedside table and the wardrobe. Arthur was standing there in shock when his phone went off. He looked down, hoping it was a text from Merlin, but instead it was a text from Morgana: How could you!! He had no idea what that meant so he texted back: ??? Almost immediately she texted back a picture. When Arthur saw it he instantly felt like throwing up. There, on his screen, was a picture of himself and the block from the club a few weeks ago kissing. The next picture showed Arthur&#x27;s hand on the man&#x27;s arse and mouth on his neck. &quot;Fuck!! Fuck !! Fuck!!&quot; Before he could say anything else, another picture came over that was even more incriminating. He fell to his knees. He knew that Merlin had seen the same pictures and that&#x27;s why he&#x27;d left. He was going to kill Gwaine but first he needed to find Merlin. He ran to his car and sped to Merlin&#x27;s flat. He used the key that Merlin had given him to get inside. Sadly, Merlin wasn&#x27;t there either. -------- After more than an hour of calling everyone he could think of to try to find Merlin, he called Gwaine. &quot;Where is he Gwaine?&quot; Arthur growled. &quot;I have no idea.&quot; Gwaine knew immediately who Arthur was talking about because, by now, he&#x27;d seen the pictures too. It appeared someone had posted them online. &quot;I should fucking kill you for doing this you bastard!&quot; he yelled into the phone. &quot;Hey, I didn&#x27;t do anything! But I did see the pictures and I guess you got what you deserved.&quot; &quot;Don&#x27;t fucking lie to me Gwaine. I know you told him and took the pictures.&quot; &quot;You stupid moron, if you look closely at the pictures you can see me in the background. Now I have to explain to my best mate why I didn&#x27;t tell him that his boyfriend is a cheating lying bastard who I caught making out with another bloke while we were out celebrating with Will. I can&#x27;t even believe what a fucking arse you are,&quot; Gwaine said before he hung up on him. -------- Monday morning Morgana walked into Arthur&#x27;s office and just shook her head. She was so angry and disappointed in him that she didn&#x27;t even know where to begin. Arthur spoke before she had a chance. &quot;I need to find out who took those pictures so I can kill them,&quot; he growled. &quot;You know what? Instead of trying to find out who to blame for taking the pictures, maybe you should look in the mirror and see that you only have yourself to blame for being in this situation in the first place. If you hadn&#x27;t cheated on Merlin then none of this would&#x27;ve happened,&quot; Morgana told him. &quot;Don&#x27;t you think I don&#x27;t already fucking know that!&quot; he yelled. &quot;You can yell at me all you want but you&#x27;re the one who fucked everything up! I hope you&#x27;re happy.&quot; She then turned and left his office slamming the door on the way out. -------- It&#x27;d been almost a week and Arthur still hadn&#x27;t found Merlin. He was going crazy with worry but finally, after pestering Gwaine relentlessly, he assured him that Merlin was safe but wouldn&#x27;t tell him where he was. Arthur had been texting Merlin almost hourly since Friday night, without any reply. Not knowing what else to do, he just continued texting him, hoping and praying he&#x27;d eventually respond. From Arthur: I&#x27;m so sorry. I love you. From Arthur: Please can I see you so I can explain? Then, on Thursday, he finally got a reply. -------- Merlin&#x27;s Mum had welcomed him home with open arms. She held him and let him cry on her shoulder. As the days passed, with his Mum&#x27;s love and support, he felt he was finally strong enough to face Arthur so he took the train back to London and sent Arthur a text. From Merlin: coffee shop at 7 From Arthur: I&#x27;ll be there. I love you and I&#x27;m sorry. -------- &quot;You obviously don&#x27;t trust me,&quot; Merlin signed. &quot;No, I swear, I do trust you,&quot; Arthur signed back. &quot;Well, it doesn&#x27;t really matter anymore because I don&#x27;t trust you,&quot; Merlin said using his hands. They continued signing back and forth. &quot;Please, I&#x27;m so sorry. I never meant to hurt you.&quot; &quot;Well you did a pretty good job of it. I never have and never would cheat on you. Can you say the same?&quot; Arthur got down on his knees in front of Merlin. He didn&#x27;t care that he was in the middle of a coffee shop or that there were people looking at him. He signed, &quot;I&#x27;m so so sorry. Merlin, I love you more than anything in the world and I swear I will never hurt you again. Please...what can I do to get you to forgive me? I&#x27;m so sorry. I&#x27;ll do anything, just tell me what to do.&quot; Merlin looked at him with such sadness in his eyes it was killing Arthur knowing he was the one that put it there. &quot;I&#x27;m sorry too, good-bye Arthur,&quot; he signed as he stood up to leave. Arthur quickly stood and grabbed Merlin&#x27;s arms and pulled him close so he could wrap him in a hug and just held onto him as tears were steaming down his face. Merlin finally pulled free of his embrace and looked at Arthur one last time, tears running down his own cheeks and mouthed the words, &quot;good-bye.&quot; Arthur tried one last time by signing, &quot;don&#x27;t say good-bye. Please, I&#x27;m begging you, please don&#x27;t say good-bye.&quot; Merlin gave him a sad little smile as he turned and walked out the door. -------- From Arthur: I love you and I&#x27;m not going to give up on us. From Arthur: I love you and no matter how long it takes for you to forgive me, I&#x27;ll be waiting. From Arthur: I love you. You&#x27;re all I care about. From Arthur: I love you. It&#x27;s not the end for us. I&#x27;ll wait forever. Arthur continued sending Merlin texts several times a day. Each one started with &#x27;I love you&#x27; but he never got any response. -------- Over the following weeks, Arthur ran into Merlin as often as he could, making sure he shopped at the same places Merlin did. He would always greet him with sad puppy dog eyes and sign, &quot;I love you and miss you so much. Can we please try again?&quot; Every time Merlin would just shake his head no and sadly walk away. Not being with Merlin anymore was killing Arthur and he had to find a way to fix it. Gwaine, Gwen, Lance, Percy, Leon and Morgana had finally forgiven him for hurting Merlin. He was happy about that but it wasn&#x27;t their forgiveness that he was desperately seeking. -------- For Merlin, every encounter with Arthur felt like pouring salt in an open wound. Why wouldn&#x27;t he just leave Merlin alone so he could try to heal his broken heart. -------- Several months had past since he&#x27;d lost Merlin and Arthur was desperate. He asked their friends if he could join them at the pub when they all got together. The group was divided but finally, after seeing how desperate Arthur was to win Merlin back, they agreed to let him come. -------- Merlin wasn&#x27;t over Arthur by any stretch of the imagination but he thought he was doing better. Arthur continued running into him but it was getting easier to just turn and walk away. Then he walked into the pub and saw Arthur there, with all their friends. He knew he wasn&#x27;t strong enough to sit down at a table with him so he turned and walked right back out of the pub. From Arthur: I&#x27;m sorry. Please come back. I&#x27;ll leave. His friends all sent him texts telling him they were sorry and to please come back but he refused. They even told him they wouldn&#x27;t let Arthur join them anymore but Merlin didn&#x27;t want to be selfish. After all, Arthur was their friend too. The next week Merlin didn&#x27;t show up. But the following week Gwen and Gwaine were able to convince him to join them again. Over the following weeks, Arthur felt the distance between them closing inch by inch. ------- Two months later -------- The whole gang was at the pub. Merlin was the last to show up and when he finally did he was acting nervous. Everyone seemed to notice and Gwaine signed, &quot;what&#x27;s going on? Are you okay?&quot; Merlin just nodded his head yes and pretty much chugged the beer that was already on the table waiting for him. They were all concerned but could tell Merlin didn&#x27;t want to talk about it so everyone got up to dance leaving Merlin and Arthur alone at the table. Once alone, Arthur signed, &quot;what&#x27;s going on?&quot; When he saw Merlin shake his head he continued. &quot;Merlin, I know something&#x27;s wrong. Please tell me.&quot; Merlin then looked over Arthur&#x27;s shoulder and his eyes went wide. Arthur turned around to where Merlin was looking and saw Mordred standing there staring at Merlin. Arthur touched Merlin&#x27;s hand to get his attention before signing, &quot;did he do something to you?&quot; Merlin just shook his head trying to get Arthur to drop it but he wouldn&#x27;t. &quot;Merlin, please tell me what Mordred did.&quot; -------- Mordred had wanted to date Merlin and Arthur knew it. Even after they were together, Mordred still persisted. Merlin tried to let him down as nicely as possible but when that didn&#x27;t work, Arthur threatened him. After that Mordred backed off. Over the past couple of months since Merlin and Arthur had broken up, he&#x27;d become obsessed with Merlin. Merlin constantly felt like he was being watched and knew it was Mordred. He&#x27;d see Mordred watching him from the other side of the street when he got to work and, no matter what time he left, Mordred would always be there waiting and watching as he left. Just this morning, when Merlin left his flat to go to work, there was a single red rose with a note attached to it laying just outside his door. It said, &quot;you will be mine.&quot; It creeped Merlin out knowing that Mordred knew where he lived. When he left work to go to the pub, he didn&#x27;t see Mordred across the street so he was relieved. Unfortunately, Mordred came up behind him seemingly out of nowhere and pulled Merlin&#x27;s arm up behind his back and put his other hand over his mouth to keep him from yelling out for help as he pushed him into the alley just past his office building. Merlin was frantic. He was doing everything he could to get away but was limited in his options because of Mordred&#x27;s hold on his arm. Once in the alley, Mordred finally let it go and pushed him against the wall so they were now facing each other. He grabbed Merlin&#x27;s wrists and pinned them above his head as he pressed his body flush against Merlin&#x27;s keeping him in place as he started kissing him. Merlin wasn&#x27;t able to get his arms out of Mordred&#x27;s grip but he was able to bring his knee up into his groin. It was enough to cause him to release his grip on Merlin. Merlin took off and when he got to the pub, he was hoping he&#x27;d lost him. Then, when he looked up and saw Mordred, his heart sank. -------- Arthur turned back towards Merlin and saw the color had drained from his face. He then noticed the bruises around his wrists and started getting angry. &quot;Did Mordred do this?&quot; he signed before he gently rubbed his thumbs over the bruises. Merlin&#x27;s eyes started to tear up. He just wanted Mordred to leave him alone and now, he knew he&#x27;d made him angrier. Arthur moved over to the chair beside Merlin&#x27;s and pulled him into his arms and just held him. He was so thankful that Merlin let him. He could feel it when Merlin slowly relaxed in his arms. When Arthur looked back up, Mordred was glaring at Merlin. He looked so deranged that Arthur was instantly concerned for Merlin&#x27;s safety. All of a sudden it dawned on him. It had been Mordred who&#x27;d taken and sent those pictures of Arthur. He remembered seeing him at the club that night. He knew Mordred must have sent the pictures hoping to break them up so he could have Merlin for himself. He may have succeeded in breaking them up but Arthur would make sure that Mordred would never have Merlin for himself. -------- When everyone came back to the table, Arthur stood up and told Gwaine he needed to see him. Once he was standing behind Merlin, where Merlin couldn&#x27;t see him, he said to all their friends, &quot;don&#x27;t leave Merlin alone. Mordred is right over there and he hurt Merlin. I&#x27;ll be right back.&quot; Merlin had told Gwen that he&#x27;d caught Mordred following him a couple of times but played it off as nothing serious. She told everyone else but whenever anyone questioned him about it, he&#x27;d tell them it was nothing to worry about. &quot;What&#x27;d he do to Merlin? I&#x27;m going to make him pay,&quot; Gwaine growled once they&#x27;d stepped away from the table. &quot;I don&#x27;t know but Merlin&#x27;s wrists are both bruised and after you guys went to dance, Merlin saw him and I could tell he was spooked.&quot; &quot;I knew he wasn&#x27;t telling me something,&quot; Gwaine said. &quot;I&#x27;ve got to get him out of here. I&#x27;m going to take him back to my flat but I don&#x27;t want Mordred following us so can you distract him so I can get Merlin out the back?&quot; Arthur asked. &quot;Yeah, I&#x27;ll take care of it. But maybe he should come home with me. You know, since everything that&#x27;s happened between you two.&quot; &quot;No! He&#x27;s coming home with me so I can protect him.&quot; &quot;Okay, I just hope he&#x27;ll agree to that.&quot; -------- Ten minutes later, Gwaine walked over to Mordred and spilled his drink down the front of him causing the two men to get into an argument. Arthur quickly got Merlin&#x27;s attention and signed, &quot;come with me.&quot; When Merlin looked at him confused, he added, &quot;please, do you trust me?&quot; Merlin finally nodded his head yes so Arthur grabbed his hand and squeezed it before guiding Merlin to the back of the pub and out the door. Soon they were at Arthur&#x27;s car and he opened the door for Merlin before he quickly went around and got in the driver&#x27;s seat. Within twenty minutes they were at Arthur&#x27;s flat. Merlin looked at him with such sadness it broke his heart. &quot;Please come in and let me take care of you,&quot; Arthur signed as he was pleading with his eyes. Merlin nodded yes and Arthur felt so relieved. He led Merlin in and had him sit down on the sofa while he went and made them both a cup of tea. When he returned, Merlin was sitting with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands. Arthur set the cups down on the coffee table and he got down on his knees in front of Merlin. Merlin looked so lost and confused that Arthur couldn&#x27;t stop himself from pulling him into his arms to comfort him. For the first time in months, Arthur felt Merlin&#x27;s arms wrap around him. Merlin was just so tired. He was tired of being sad. He was tired of feeling betrayed. He was tired of missing Arthur. He was tired of worrying about what Mordred might do. He wanted to go to sleep and have everything that made him so tired disappear by the time he woke up. Being in Arthur&#x27;s arms again made it feel like that was possible. Arthur could tell that Merlin was starting to fall asleep so he let go of him in order to rearrange Merlin into a more comfortable position where he was laying down on the sofa. Arthur then sat back down on the floor by Merlin&#x27;s head and gently stroked his hair trying to help him go to sleep. Merlin looked at him and saw Arthur&#x27;s love for him in his eyes. &quot;Hold me please?&quot; Merlin signed. Arthur smiled brightly as he nodded his head and moved up onto the sofa and maneuvered himself so he was on his back and had pulled Merlin so half his body was draped over him. He then tightened his arms around him and pressed kisses in his hair. Before they both fell asleep, he let go long enough to sign &quot;I love you&quot; and then wrapped his arms around Merlin once again. Arthur knew they had a long way to go to get back to where they were before but he hoped and prayed that this was the start of that process. -------- Mordred was furious that Gwaine had spilled his drink on him. Once they were done yelling at each other, he looked up only to find Merlin was gone. &quot;Where&#x27;d he go?!&quot; &quot;Who?&quot; Gwaine asked all innocently. &quot;You know damn well who! Where&#x27;s Merlin?!&quot; &quot;Fuck off and stay away from him if you know what&#x27;s good for you,&quot; Gwaine threatened. Mordred just glared at him before he rushed into the loo trying to find Merlin. When he didn&#x27;t find him there he rushed out the back door but by then Merlin and Arthur were already gone. Mordred decided to go to Merlin&#x27;s flat and wait for him there. -------- Merlin woke up the next morning feeling safe and warm. He felt a hand slowly running up and down his back while another hand was stroking his hair gently. It took him a few seconds before he remembered where he was and who he was with. He moved just enough so he could see Arthur&#x27;s face. Once Arthur realized he was awake, he stilled both his hands and looked down at Merlin and gave him a heartwarming smile and mouthed &quot;I love you&quot; to him. Merlin gave him a small smile in return before he put his head back down on Arthur&#x27;s chest so he could enjoy this feeling for a few more minutes before reality slapped him in the face. Merlin felt Arthur&#x27;s lips brush against his forehead and he closed his eyes and just savored the feeling. Finally, he sat up. &quot;Sorry about falling asleep like that last night. I shouldn&#x27;t have asked you to be my pillow,&quot; he signed as he gave Arthur a bashful smile. &quot;I&#x27;ll gladly be your pillow whenever you want,&quot; Arthur signed back looking sincere. &quot;If you want, you can take a shower and I&#x27;ll make us breakfast. Everything&#x27;s where it&#x27;s always been and I still have a few pair of your boxers and a couple shirts in the dresser.&quot; Merlin gave him a shy smile as he made his way to the bathroom. Once there, he noticed that Arthur still had his kind of shampoo in the shower and still even had his toothbrush and razor in the cabinet. Knowing Arthur had kept these things really warmed his heart. Once he was finished, he wrapped a towel around his waist before he left the bathroom and walked into Arthur&#x27;s bedroom. He was caught off guard by the sight of Arthur standing there shirtless. Arthur had just finished pulling on a clean pair of jeans when he saw Merlin walk into his room in nothing but a towel. He couldn&#x27;t take his eyes off him. It&#x27;d been too long since he&#x27;d seen him like this. He noticed the blush that was spreading from Merlin&#x27;s face down his neck to his chest and then realized he&#x27;d been staring this whole time. &quot;Oh, sorry, I&#x27;m sorry, I&#x27;ll just go put breakfast on plates for us,&quot; he signed looking and feeling embarrassed at being caught staring at Merlin&#x27;s near naked body. He knew no one in their right mind could ever blame him for it though because Merlin was gorgeous. He quickly pulled a shirt over his head and left the room. A few minutes later Merlin appeared in the kitchen wearing one of his own shirts that Arthur had kept for him. &quot;Thanks,&quot; he mouthed as he sat down and they both started eating the breakfast Arthur made. -------- &quot;I should get home,&quot; Merlin signed after they&#x27;d cleaned up their dishes. &quot;Please tell me what&#x27;s going on with Mordred before you leave,&quot; Arthur asked in sign. Merlin took a deep breath and looked at Arthur. When he saw how desperate and worried he was, he decided to tell him everything including how Mordred attacked him last night on his way to the pub. He then remembered that he&#x27;d shoved the note Mordred had left outside his door in his pocket, so he pulled it out and showed it to Arthur too. Arthur looked like he was ready to explode. When he looked at Merlin and saw his fear, he forced himself to calm down. &quot;I don&#x27;t want you to go back to your flat. It&#x27;s not safe. Please stay here,&quot; signed Arthur. Merlin shook his head no. &quot;I&#x27;m at least going to take you back to your place and make sure you&#x27;re safe.&quot; Merlin didn&#x27;t argue so they left and went to Merlin&#x27;s flat. As soon as they got there, Merlin unlocked his door but suddenly stopped after he&#x27;d only taken a few steps inside. When Arthur saw what caused Merlin to stop, he quickly moved to stand in front of him. There, sitting on Merlin&#x27;s sofa, was Mordred. He was eating a sandwich and drinking a beer while watching television like he lived there. &quot;What the fuck do you think you&#x27;re doing here?!&quot; Arthur yelled as he reached back to make sure Merlin stayed behind him so he&#x27;d be able to protect him better, if need be. &quot;I live here. What the fuck are you doing here?!&quot; Mordred yelled back. &quot;Get out of here now before I call the cops,&quot; Arthur told him. &quot;No, I don&#x27;t think I will. You need to give me Merlin and get yourself the fuck out of here and leave us alone!&quot; Arthur turned so he could sign to Merlin to get out of the flat now but, as soon as he did, Mordred made his move and smashed his beer bottle over Arthur&#x27;s head, knocking him out. He then grabbed Merlin as he was bending down to check on Arthur and threw him against the wall. He knocked his head into the wall until he was dizzy and could barely stand. Mordred was far from done with Merlin though. He drug him over and threw him towards the sofa but he hit the coffee table instead. Mordred grabbed him by the hair and pulled him onto the sofa and then climbed on top of him. Merlin used his legs to flip him over enough so he could knock Mordred to the floor. This only served to anger him more. Before Merlin was even able to get off the sofa, Mordred started throwing punches in his face, quickly causing his nose and then his lip to bleed. He was able to get a few of his own punches to land on Mordred&#x27;s face and chest before Mordred smashed his fist into Merlin&#x27;s eye, causing him to see stars. He then felt his neck being crushed as his ability to breathe was being taken away. Then everything went black. Arthur regained consciousness and looked around to find Mordred chocking Merlin. He jumped to his feet and yanked Mordred off Merlin and threw him into the coffee table. He smashed his head against it until he knocked him out and quickly went to Merlin. &quot;Oh God, Merlin, please, wake up...you have to wake up...come on honey, wake up for me please,&quot; he cried as he tried waking him without causing anymore damage. Just then, the door flew open and four cops came charging in with their guns drawn. &quot;Please, he needs help! He won&#x27;t wake up! Please help him!&quot; Arthur yelled at them. &quot;Is there anyone else in the flat?!&quot; one of the officers demanded. &quot;No! He won&#x27;t wake up! Please help him!&quot; he pleaded. With this, two officers went to search the rest of the flat while the other two stayed in the room. Paramedics quickly entered and rushed to Merlin&#x27;s side, pushing Arthur out of the way. Another paramedic entered and was checking on Mordred when he finally came to. Arthur, seeing him awake, went to attack him but was stopped by the cops. &quot;He tried to kill Merlin! Oh God, he tried to kill Merlin!&quot; he yelled as he broke down in tears. &quot;Who are you to the victim?&quot; one of the cops asked. &quot;I&#x27;m his boyfriend. How is he?!&quot; Arthur demanded. They both looked over just in time to see the paramedics gently roll Merlin onto a backboard before lifting him onto the stretcher. They quickly got him secured onto it and pushed him out the door. Arthur rushed out to follow with one of the cops by his side. &quot;Sir, you need to get checked out by the paramedics because you appear to be bleeding.&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m fine. I need to be with Merlin,&quot; he told the cop. &quot;Alright, I&#x27;ll drive you to the hospital but you&#x27;ll need to get seen to there.&quot; &quot;Whatever, please, I need to be with Merlin.&quot; -------- Arthur was pacing in the emergency department waiting room. He&#x27;d already been examined and, after getting twelve stitches on the back of his head, he was anxiously waiting for news on Merlin. Gwaine, Gwen, Lance, Percy, Morgana and Leon were there with him. &quot;What&#x27;s taking so long?&quot; Arthur asked no one in particular. &quot;He&#x27;s going to be okay Arthur,&quot; Morgana said trying to comfort him. The police officers had already taken his statement and Mordred, after he was examined at the hospital, was arrested and taken to jail. The cops had told him that Mordred had gotten into Merlin&#x27;s flat by breaking the bedroom window. Finally, after what felt like days, a doctor came out to talk to them. &quot;Mr. Emrys has suffered a broken nose and his jaw and his eye socket have both been fractured. Luckily, there doesn&#x27;t appear to be any damage to his eye which is great and we should be able to fix the jaw with pins and wires. His throat is severely bruised from the choking and his ribs are also badly bruised so he&#x27;ll be pretty sore for awhile. He also has a minor concussion but overall, I&#x27;d say he got off pretty good after the beating he received. &quot;When can I see him?&quot; Arthur asked with a shaky voice. He didn&#x27;t know if he wanted to scream, cry or punch someone. &quot;Give us about an hour and then you should be able to see him for a few minutes. A nurse will let you know when. We&#x27;re going to obviously admit him and if there are no complications from any of his injuries, he should be able to go home in a few days. If anything changes with his condition, we&#x27;ll let you know, otherwise, like I said, you should be able to see him soon,&quot; the doctor said before he walked away. -------- A nurse finally came over and told the group of friends that one person could go back to see Merlin. Arthur jumped up and quickly followed her to Merlin&#x27;s bedside. He looked terrible. His face was all swollen and was starting to turn black and blue. One eye was swelled shut and the other one was closed. Arthur panicked and quickly asked the nurse if he was okay. &quot;Yes, he&#x27;s just resting. We gave him some medicine for the pain and are monitoring him closely because of the concussion. He may not wake up for awhile,&quot; the nurse told him. Arthur pulled a chair as close to the bed as he could get it and held onto Merlin&#x27;s hand tightly. Merlin didn&#x27;t wake up before Arthur was told he needed to leave, which he very reluctantly did. He was informed he could come back to see him in the morning. -------- The next morning, Arthur was again sitting beside Merlin&#x27;s bed holding his hand. Merlin had been moved sometime overnight to a different room. The nurse told him that Merlin had woken up late last night and was awake for several hours before he went back to sleep. As soon as Merlin started to stir, Arthur moved so he was sitting on the edge of his bed. Merlin slowly opened his good eye and looked around, obviously confused. Then he saw Arthur and gave him a small grin before his jaw started to hurt. &quot;Hi, how are you feeling?&quot; Arthur signed. Merlin closed his eye and just barely shook his head. Once he opened his eye, he signed to Arthur, &quot;are you okay? I saw him knock you out and I was so scared...&quot; Arthur gently grabbed Merlin&#x27;s hands to still them so he could talk. &quot;I&#x27;m fine, it&#x27;s you that&#x27;s laying here in a hospital bed. I&#x27;m so sorry I didn&#x27;t protect you,&quot; Arthur signed as tears started to fill his eyes. Merlin just gave him a puzzled look so he continued. &quot;I never should have turned my back on Mordred. If I wouldn&#x27;t have, you wouldn&#x27;t be hurt. That&#x27;s all I ever seem to do to you. I am so so sorry.&quot; He finally couldn&#x27;t take it anymore and he broke down and put his head down in his hands. He felt Merlin&#x27;s hands on his arms gently pulling him down so he could lay his head on Merlin&#x27;s chest, which he did very gently because of his ribs. He then felt Merlin&#x27;s hands trying to soothe him by rubbing his back and neck. He finally composed himself enough to sit up so he could talk to Merlin some more. He started by signing, &quot;I love you so much and I thought I&#x27;d lost you when I saw you laying there covered in blood...I can&#x27;t lose you Merlin, I just can&#x27;t.&quot; He then broke down again. Merlin finally got his attention so he could sign. &quot;You didn&#x27;t lose me, you saved me. I&#x27;m still here thanks to you.&quot; &quot;You shouldn&#x27;t have gotten hurt. I never should have turned my back on him...&quot; This time it was Merlin that stilled Arthur&#x27;s hands before he started signing. &quot;Stop it. Stop blaming yourself. You didn&#x27;t know he would attack like that? Arthur, you saved me and I can never repay you for that.&quot; Arthur just stared at him for a minute before he slowly brought his hand up and gently ran his fingers over Merlin&#x27;s cheek and then down to his swollen lips. He wanted to lean over and kiss those lips so desperately but instead he leaned down and placed a kiss on his forehead. He sat back up and mouthed, &quot;I love you.&quot; &quot;I love you too,&quot; Merlin signed back. Arthur stared at him in disbelief. Finally he signed, &quot;can you please repeat that?&quot; &quot;I love you,&quot; Merlin repeated with his hands. A smile instantly spread across Arthur&#x27;s face upon seeing those words coming from Merlin. &quot;I love you so much, you have no idea. Thank you...thank you...thank you,&quot; he signed before grabbing Merlin&#x27;s hands and kissing them both. He then put Merlin&#x27;s hands on his chest over his heart and held them there for a minute before he let go to sign, &quot;you have my heart always and forever.&quot; -------- Before Merlin was released from the hospital, Gwaine, Lance, Leon and Percy went over and cleaned up his flat. They didn&#x27;t want the girls to see the place because they had taken Merlin&#x27;s attack hard enough without seeing further evidence of it. They couldn&#x27;t get the blood stains out of his sofa so they threw it out and bought him a new one. They also replaced a broken lamp and coffee table and had to repaint some of the wall where there were blood stains that wouldn&#x27;t wipe off. The bedroom window had already been replaced before they even got there so, other than the new furnishings, you&#x27;d never know anything had happened there. -------- Merlin was released from the hospital a few days later with orders to take it easy for at least the next week. He wanted to go back to his own flat so Arthur asked if he could stay there with him while he recovered which Merlin agreed to. They both knew they still had a lot to talk about and trust issues to overcome before they could completely put the past behind them but they were hopefully moving in the right direction. One week quickly turned into two. Arthur took wonderful care of Merlin. Arthur made him feel loved and cherished with every little thing he did for him. They were slowly rebuilding their relationship piece by piece. It was always Arthur that initiated any physical contact between them, like rubbing Merlin&#x27;s shoulders or holding his hand or gently caressing his cheeks. He would give Merlin kisses on the top of his head or forehead and even gave him a couple gentle pecks on his cheek, but so far Merlin never took the initiative to touch him. Then, one evening, Merlin shocked him when he reached out and grabbed Arthur&#x27;s hand while they were watching a movie. He looked over and saw Merlin watching him intently. All of a sudden, they were both leaning towards the other until their lips finally met for the first time in months. They had to keep the kisses gentle because Merlin&#x27;s lip was still sore as well as his jaw. After that, Arthur felt like they were definitely on the way to recovering what they&#x27;d lost. One night, they were on the sofa with Merlin&#x27;s back pressed to Arthur&#x27;s chest and Arthur&#x27;s arms wrapped around him when Merlin tapped Arthur&#x27;s hand to get his attention before he signed, &quot;why?&quot; Arthur knew exactly what Merlin was asking him with that one word. &quot;Because I was stupid and I was jealous,&quot; he signed. He still had Merlin pressed against his chest so he held his hands out in front of Merlin so he could read them. &quot;Why?&quot; &quot;You know Cendred cheated on me. It hurt but it was nothing compared to how I felt when I saw you hugging Freya. I love you with all my heart. I want to marry you and spend my life with you, I pretty much have since our first date. I saw you with her and it was like my life was over in that moment. You&#x27;re everything I&#x27;ve ever wanted and so much more and I saw it disappearing and I couldn&#x27;t stand it so I did the stupidest and worst thing I&#x27;ve ever done in my life,&quot; Arthur signed. He stopped for a minute to wrap his arms around Merlin before he let go so he could continue. &quot;Sometimes I just look at you and wonder what you could possibly see in me that would make me worthy enough to be loved by you. You are the most wonderful person I&#x27;ve ever met and you could have anyone so I don&#x27;t know why you chose me. Then I went and ruined in...&quot; &quot;You didn&#x27;t ruin it, not permanently at least,&quot; Merlin answered with his hands. &quot;It&#x27;s you that could have anyone so I don&#x27;t know why you&#x27;d want a goofy-looking, big-eared deaf guy.&quot; &quot;First, you are not goofy-looking, you are gorgeous,&quot; Arthur signed and gave him a kiss on the cheek. &quot;Second, I love your ears. They are perfect just like the rest of you,&quot; and he gave one and then the other ear a nibble followed by kiss. &quot;Third, you have the prettiest hands I&#x27;ve ever seen and I get mesmerized just watching them as you sign,&quot; and with that he grabbed Merlin&#x27;s hands and kissed each finger. Merlin feel asleep in Arthur&#x27;s arms that night. When Arthur carried him into the bedroom and gently laid him on the bed, Merlin woke up signed, &quot;stay.&quot; Arthur nodded as he gave him a smile and quickly took off his jeans before he crawled in and ever so carefully pulled Merlin back against him so he could wrap him safely in his arms. He held him like that all night long. That was the first night they&#x27;d spent in bed together since their break-up. Up until then, Arthur had been sleeping on the sofa. After that night, things got much easier for them and from then on, he only slept in Merlin&#x27;s bed. -------- Arthur never left Merlin&#x27;s flat. His clothing, electronics and other belongings just gradually migrated there. It wasn&#x27;t something they&#x27;d really discussed, it just kind of happened and it seemed so natural. Arthur knew one day he&#x27;d like them to move into a bigger flat or possibly even a house but he had other things he needed to accomplish with Merlin first. -------- Five months later -------- It was a nice sunny Saturday in June when Arthur surprised Merlin by packing them a picnic lunch. He drove out into the country where he parked close to a lake. He opened the boot of the car and grabbed the picnic basket along with a blanket he&#x27;d packed and they walked down to the lake. Arthur spread the blanket under a tree and they enjoyed the simple meal he&#x27;d made. Arthur was sitting with his back against a tree while Merlin was sitting between his legs with his back pressed to Arthur&#x27;s chest, Arthur&#x27;s arms wrapped tightly around him. This was Arthur&#x27;s favorite way to cuddle with Merlin. They were sitting there with their heads turned so they could kiss each other. Once they pulled apart for much needed air, Arthur started kissing and sucking on Merlin&#x27;s neck causing him to squirm because his neck was very sensitive and ticklish. Arthur finally stopped the torture and Merlin leaned his head back so it was resting on Arthur&#x27;s shoulder. They stayed like this for awhile until Arthur felt like he couldn&#x27;t wait another minute. He kissed Merlin on the temple and tickled his hip to get his attention. He then started signing with his hands held out in front of Merlin. &quot;I love you more than anything in this world. Will you marry me?&quot; Merlin suddenly sat up straight and turned around in Arthur&#x27;s arms so he was facing him. Arthur signed again, &quot;will you marry me?&quot; All of a sudden a smile spread across Merlin&#x27;s face as he nodded yes before he threw his arms around Arthur&#x27;s neck so they could kiss each other properly. As soon as they broke apart, Arthur reached for Merlin&#x27;s hand and slipped a gold band he&#x27;d had specially made onto his fiancé&#x27;s finger. &quot;I love you. You&#x27;ve made me the happiest man alive,&quot; Arthur signed. &quot;I love you too,&quot; Merlin mouthed before going back to kissing his husband-to-be. -------- Three months later -------- &quot;...I now pronounce you married. You may kiss your husband,&quot; the preacher said as Gwaine stood beside him and signed his spoken words for Merlin. After their reception, the grooms left on their week-long honeymoon to France. When they returned, they settled into married life in their new three bedroom house. -------- One year later -------- &quot;I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s finally here,&quot; Merlin signed to his husband as they were sitting in the hospital maternity ward anxiously awaiting the birth of their soon to be adopted daughter. &quot;You&#x27;re going to be a great daddy,&quot; Arthur signed to him before he pulled him into his arms. Merlin pulled back just far enough so he could move his hands to say, &quot;and you&#x27;re going to be a wonderful papa.&quot; -------- Soon after Emily was born, they were lucky enough to be able to adopt a little boy they named Ben. They were thrilled that their kids were so close in age. -------- Five years later -------- Arthur and Merlin were kicking the ball around in the park with their kids. Arthur looked over at his husband and saw him smiling brightly. It was one of Arthur&#x27;s most favorite sights in the world so he walked over to him and mouthed &quot;I love you&quot; before he pulled Merlin in for a kiss and then just held him in his arms. He couldn&#x27;t believe how his life had turned out. Merlin had given him the greatest gift of all...a second chance, and now he had this wonderful life and family. Arthur held Merlin even tighter as he said to himself, &quot;and it&#x27;s all because of you.&quot; The end.

Notes See the end of the work for notes When Arthur died the world became a bleak place for Merlin, he no longer saw it as a wonderful place. Everywhere he looked he saw traces of Arthur so in the end he just stopped looking, choosing to see the world as black and white thanks to his magic. He didn&#x27;t return to Camelot, he stayed by the lake hoping Arthur would suddenly reemerge. After a while, when Gwen and everyone else had died he moved away. Merlin promised he&#x27;d return, but he never really had reason too, the time never felt right. So he travelled, far and wide, meeting people who brightened his world just a little bit, but like everyone else before them they left Merlin. When he eventually came back home Camelot was a ruin and all traces of the life he had lived had gone, along with everyone else. The dragon had said Arthur would return in a time of need but as Merlin watched civilisations fall and wars destroy he began to lose hope. As time passed others began to return to him, Gwaine was the first; a rugged Irishman this time who was still fond of his ale and apples, then Gwen and even Morgana. As Merlin found the people who he had lost so long ago, he hoped Arthur would join him again, but there was peace for now. So when Merlin heard the faint echo of &#x27;Merlin&#x27; in the back of his head while watching TV with Gwaine it was completely unexpected. But it was Arthur, the colours he had dulled for so long bloomed into his vision as he sprinted out of the door leaving a baffled Gwaine in his wake. He had waited over 3,000 years for Arthur and he wasn&#x27;t going to be kept waiting any longer. Merlin reached the lake in record time and his breath caught in his throat as he caught sight of Arthur for the first time in a long time. Arthur turned to face Merlin, the confused look sliding off his face to be replaced by one of pure joy. Merlin barrelled into him clinging him like he was a lifeline, burying his head into Arthurs neck. Arthur wrapped his arms around him hugging him tightly, Merlin wasn&#x27;t the only one who had waited a long time for this. &#x27;&#x27;Miss me idiot?&#x27;&#x27; &quot;Like you wouldn&#x27;t believe dollop head.&quot; End Notes This is my first fic for this fandom and pairing.

Arthur was making his way outdoors to go to the training grounds when Sir Leon ran up to him, out of breath. “Sire, there is commotion at the stables.” When they arrived, it was to see Percival and Gwaine kneeling beside someone lying on the ground. Percival looked up at Arthur, his expression worried. “I don’t think he’s hurt too badly. The cat was on the roof,” were his only words. He looked as if he wanted to say more, but Arthur put up a hand and shook his head. He’d talk to Percival more in- depth later, but he’d heard all he needed for now. He had more important things to worry about. He didn’t need to look down to see who it was on the ground. Percival wouldn’t have given him that look unless it was Merlin. Arthur pushed the others out of his way and carefully picked up Merlin, only worrying afterwards that perhaps he should have left him on the ground until he could be checked out for injuries, but as Merlin was trying to talk, Arthur took that as a positive sign. He visibly relaxed once he saw that the damage didn’t seem too bad, and he briefly wondered whether he wanted to throttle Merlin or kiss him more. He opened his mouth to ask what had happened when he heard a familiar meow. Arthur sighed. He should have known. Damned cat! If Arthur had told Merlin once he’d told him a hundred times to not play with that cat! Hadn’t Arthur told him to be careful, that the cat didn’t like to be cuddled? It was a cat after all, even if it was small and perhaps a smidgeon cute and adorable. Arthur would have to have words with Percival, but first he had to take care of Merlin. Careful not to jostle Merlin, Arthur continued to glare at the cat. He had half a mind to put his sword through it, but he knew that if he did, Merlin would never forgive him, and Percival wouldn’t be happy either. “You are a menace to society, cat,” he said instead, glaring at it, but the look the feline gave him had Arthur thinking that he was the one being reprimanded, not the cat. The thought made Arthur chuckle. “I don’t know who is more the idiot here, you or Merlin.” Arthur made a shooing motion with his hand, but the cat refused to move. Arthur was about to kick it when Merlin opened an eye and cleared his throat. Arthur had been caught. Damn Merlin and his sixth sense! “You leave that cat alone, Arthur. He didn’t do anything to you.” Arthur let out another laugh. Merlin was amazing… an amazing idiot. The amazing idiot that Arthur just so happened to love. “No, but he nearly killed you. Am I not allowed to be upset about that?” Merlin tried to laugh, but grimaced, probably in pain. “If you want to be angry with someone, be angry with me. I was the one who decided to go up there to get the cat. That cat didn’t coax me onto the roof. I am a big boy, Arthur, and I can make my own decisions, believe it or not,” he finished, with more than a little condescension in his voice. All the fight went out of Arthur. As angry as he was with Merlin, and he was plenty angry, he was more thankful. Merlin could have easily been killed in the fall. Silly boy. Hadn’t he been told to stay in bed until he was over the sweating sickness? Gaius had lectured him about how important it was to get his strength back, and he had forbade Merlin to go back to work for a fortnight. The recovery period had seemed excessive to Arthur, but who was he to tell the Court Physician what was right and what was wrong when it came to medical conditions? Yes, he was King of Camelot, but if that qualified him to make diagnoses of the medical persuasion, he hadn’t been informed, thus, until that day arrived he would leave that business to more educated people than himself. “You idiot,” he spat out. “Did you honestly think it a good idea to climb atop the stables and play the hero? What were you doing out of bed anyway? I thought you were on strict bedrest.” Merlin opened his mouth to answer Arthur, but Gaius’s concerned voice rent the air as he called after Arthur and Merlin. “He’ll live, Gaius,” said Arthur, swallowing the words he wanted to say next. “A few bumps and scratches, but I don’t think he was hurt too badly.” Once Merlin was safely back in his bed, Arthur began the inquisition. One question after another, not stopping to take a breath. “Arthur,” Merlin interrupted, rolling his eyes, “Percival’s cat came into my room. I have no idea how he got here, but he did. I decided to take him back. I knew neither you nor Gaius would be happy with me, but I thought I could get there and back before you’d notice I was gone. How was I to know the cat would get away from me and jump up on the roof of the stables?” “So, being the hero you are,” said Arthur, shaking his head in exasperation, “you just had to follow him, didn’t you?” “Yep,” said Merlin, matter-of-factly, obviously quite proud of himself. He put on this cocky attitude far too often for Arthur&#x27;s liking, but it was one of the qualities Arthur loved so much. “What am I going to do with you, Merlin?” Merlin smirked. “If you want to keep a closer eye on me, Arthur, you could always ask me to stay with you so you can play mother hen.” Such insolence could not be tolerated so Arthur did the only thing he could. He leant over to kiss Merlin. Yes, he would be moving Merlin into his chambers immediately.</span> <a href="#" class="summary-toggle">[ + ]</a></div><div class="stats"><div class="stat-item"><strong>Rating:</strong> Teen And Up Audiences</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Archive Warning:</strong> No Archive Warnings Apply</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Category:</strong> M/M</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Fandom:</strong> Merlin (TV)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Relationship:</strong> Merlin/Arthur Pendragon (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Character:</strong> Merlin (Merlin), Arthur Pendragon (Merlin), Leon (Merlin), Percival (Merlin), Gwaine (Merlin), Gaius (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Additional Tags:</strong> Caring Arthur, Hurt Merlin, Fluff, Happy Ending, overprotective Arthur, Short &amp; Sweet, Worried Arthur, Angst, Canon Era, Alternate Universe - Canon Divergence, Hurt/Comfort, Tenderness</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Collections:</strong> Camelot Drabble — Prompt #304: Saviour (Art Prompt)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Published:</strong> 2018-03-14</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Words:</strong> 1000</div></div></div><div class="work-entry"><h2 class="title"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://download.archiveofourown.org/downloads/31045454/Chamber%20Cat.pdf" target="_blank">Chamber Cat</a></h2><div class="summary"><span class="summary-short">A young mischievous cat is behind the noises and tapping at the windows outside Arthur&#x27;s chambers every night.

But cats have been banned since the Great Purge because of their associations to Witchcraft. So, what else are Arthur and Merlin to do, other than bring this mischievous feline back home and vow to protect it? Little did they know that this one cat would change the course of history in Camelot. [ Featuring: Arthur not really knowing how to act around cats, Merlin doting on the thing like it&#x27;s his own child, arguments about names, and the Knights becoming very fond of cats ] Notes I think this is, hands down, the silliest thing I&#x27;ve ever written. Just as Arthur feels himself drift off into what should be another blissful slumber — after a very excruciating day of training and chasing his hapless servant around — there comes that sound again. It started about five nights ago, each time interrupting Arthur from the brink of falling asleep. It&#x27;s a scratchy and an almost ear-piercing amalgamation of screeches and tapping. The first time it happened, he had inspected the window the following morning to see marks on the otherwise pristine glass pane. He complained about it to Merlin, to which the servant had shrugged and simply raised an eyebrow, as if to say &#x27;What do you want me to do about it?&#x27; . He&#x27;d suggested that it was probably rats, or even moths — despite Arthur&#x27;s insistence that moths do not have claws. So, rats. It had to be rats. Merlin had then just said it&#x27;s probably Arthur&#x27;s imagination, so he&#x27;d tried to ignore it. But tonight is the final straw. There&#x27;s only so much scratching and tapping he can take, so with a final grunt — and the very dramatic throwing back of his embellished silk duvets — the bone-tired Prince storms to the chamber doors. Shirtless, hair-ruffled, and cheeks puffing out in frustration, Arthur barks at the guards outside to fetch his servant. After a chorus of shouts sounding something like &#x27;Right this minute. Drag him by the scuff of the neck if you have to, but I want him here now ,&#x27; one guard runs off down the hallway. Arthur slams the door shut, which actually causes the noise to stop. He stands there for a minute, piercing his tired eyes at the unmoving curtains, trying to surmise why on earth rodents would actually be outside his window. He didn&#x27;t think they lived in those types of places at all. Then the sound starts again. Arthur is about to tear his hair out as it echoes through his head, but luckily that&#x27;s the moment Merlin enters. His hair is scruffy, he&#x27;s still in his nightshirt, and he looks exhausted. He&#x27;s quirking a very unimpressed eyebrow at his master, looking surprisingly like a younger version of Gaius, before he shrugs expectedly. &quot;So? What do you want?&quot; Arthur huffs and drags Merlin over to the window. The servant looks a little confused for a second, before realisation dawns on him and he sighs. He rubs a thumb on his forehead and yanks the curtains open. &quot;I told you, Arthur. It&#x27;s just rats. There&#x27;s really nothing I can do for you.&quot; The prince simply crosses his arms over his chest as his tired servant goes about opening the creaky window. There&#x27;s nothing on the other side of it apart from the rather chilly breeze of February and a stone window ledge. &quot;See? They&#x27;ve run off now,&quot; Merlin says, glancing to his side. &quot;Now, I&#x27;m going back to bed—&quot; &quot;Merlin!&quot; &quot;What?&quot; the servant asks exasperatedly, turning around and sighing. &quot;Do you want me to go down to the kitchens to get some turnip ends to shove in your ears? They work wonders for me when Gaius snores like an ox in winter—&quot; &quot;You didn&#x27;t even look !&quot; Arthur growls and grabs Merlin&#x27;s arm, not missing the way he winces at it. The prince shoves the man&#x27;s head out of the window. Merlin squirms a little and winces at the way the cold hits his face, before turning to Arthur wearing quite an amusing expression. &quot;I couldn&#x27;t look because they ran away! I told you that! If you&#x27;d just listen !&quot; Merlin almost shrieks, trying to squirm out from the grip Arthur has on the back of his head. But he stops talking when he sees a flash of something bigger than a rat but smaller than a human. It&#x27;s so quick, in fact, that Merlin almost misses it. But he definitely recalls seeing four legs bend with stupendous agility as it jumped up onto a distant parapet, its long tail swishing happily in the moonlight. Merlin smiles, in awe of the animal. &quot;What&#x27;s so amusing, Mer lin?&quot; Arthur asks, pulling the servant&#x27;s head back in. He swats his hand away and continues to smile like an idiot. &quot;Well?&quot; &quot;Erm ... it wasn&#x27;t a family of rats, Arthur.&quot; The prince frowns and then edges further to the window. He pokes his head out into the cold night, now reassured that he won&#x27;t get his nose bitten off by a hungry rodent. He looks left and right but sees nothing. &quot;It&#x27;s gone now, you clotpole,&quot; Merlin observes, casually standing in the chambers with his arms crossed. &quot;It was a cat all along.&quot; There&#x27;s shock on Arthur&#x27;s face, and then reassurance, and then panic. Felines have been banned from Camelot and the neighbouring lands ever since the Great Purge due to being heavily associated with all sorts of Witchcraft and sorcery. They&#x27;re either sent away to other countries — or, sadly drowned, if the sovereign with decision over the given area is feeling particularly barbaric. Namely Uther. Merlin shudders at that. &quot;But ... how is it still alive? I mean ... someone must have seen it at some point, right?&quot; the blonde asks, appearing more relaxed now that the culprit has been found. Merlin shrugs, flopping down into Arthur&#x27;s desk chair. He looks thoughtful for a second, and then a smile spreads on his face. Arthur rolls his eyes as soon as he sees it. That brazen grin could mean that anything is being brewed up in the servant&#x27;s mind. It always does. &quot;I&#x27;m not sure I want to know what you&#x27;re thinking,&quot; Arthur warns, his tone quiet and wary. He taps his fingers on the windowsill as he awaits Merlin&#x27;s answer. The servant scoots the chair around fully, making an irritating scraping sound echo around the chambers. He shrugs as if his impending proposition is obvious. &quot;We go and find it, and then ... umm, take it home.&quot; Arthur screws his face up at that and leans against the wall, eyebrows raising slowly as he tries to decipher whether or not Merlin is being entirely serious. He has that mischievous glint in his eyes and that tilting of his head. Oh, he is being wholly serious. &quot;No — think about it, Arthur,&quot; Merlin exclaims almost excitedly, leaping up from the chair on his lanky legs and joining his companion by the window. &quot;That cat is going to be seen by someone else at some point, and it&#x27;s going to be turned in and ... &quot; he trails off, sadness overwhelming his eyes. He doesn&#x27;t want to think about that, so he shakes his head. &quot;Anyway, it would have a much better chance of survival with us.&quot; &quot;Us?&quot; Merlin almost rolls his eyes. &quot;Yes, Arthur. So, what do you say?&quot; Judging by the nonchalance on Arthur&#x27;s expression and the way he is looking at Merlin like he&#x27;s gone mad, the prince is entirely agreeing. _____________________ After a few days&#x27; hunting — as they&#x27;d told anyone who asked about their absences — and a good white of falling over in the undergrowth and some even louder &#x27;shh!&#x27; &#x27;s, they&#x27;d finally found the cat&#x27;s resting place. In a sheltered area behind the Darkling Woods is a large lake and a few quiet caves. There were fish bones scattered everywhere, but apart from that, it didn’t look as if the cat had a very comfortable place to live. Of course, she — as they had spent entirely way too long trying to decipher — can survive on her own, but with the white markings, she looks to have once been domesticated. Arthur had surmised that she was most likely shunned from whichever village she&#x27;d lived in once the owner realised the risk. The moment Merlin sets the furry feline down on the chamber floor, her soft ears perk up a little. She moves one white paw forwards, as if testing the waters, and then keeps it held up by her chest. Her large green eyes are overcome with curiosity as she tilts her head this way and that. Arthur stands a little bit behind Merlin with his nose wrinkled and his arms crossed. Despite being relieved that they&#x27;ve probably just saved the agile feline&#x27;s life, he still isn&#x27;t entirely won over by the prospect of having her in his chambers all the time. On the way back, they&#x27;d had a bit of an argumentative conversation about where they were actually going to keep the cat. Morgana was suggested at some point, but Merlin had tried not to flinch at that. Of course, he didn&#x27;t want a plotting and conniving villain to have an innocent little cat in her chambers. All Merlin had told Arthur is that the hairs would get everywhere and she wouldn&#x27;t like that. Gwen’s little home would have been ideal, and she&#x27;d likely have gladly taken her, only it&#x27;s right in the centre of the Citadel and anyone hearing the cat&#x27;s seemingly rare meows is a risk they&#x27;d rather not take. Arthur&#x27;s chambers, however, are in a relatively quiet wing of the castle, and Merlin will be in there most of the time anyway to lend a hand. Plus, there&#x27;s a rather large empty cupboard, too — entirely handy to keep the cat for a while if someone decides to come knocking. Not even Arthur could dispute all of that. Damn Merlin and his reasonable wisdom. Merlin slowly crouches down to the floor, smiling softly at the cat. She turns and looks at him, opening her mouth and poking her little pink tongue in his direction. She tilts her head again, watching as the servant brings a fish out of the satchel he&#x27;d brought on the journey. He then tosses the fish to the other side of the chambers. &quot;You&#x27;re cleaning that up,&quot; Arthur says, unamused, as he watches the fish slide across the stone floor and thump into a table leg. The cat leaps forwards, her almost white fur glinting in the evening sun and every joint moving with glorious agility. There&#x27;s a light grey stripe that runs down from the base of her ears all the way down to the base of the tail, which is arguably one of her most striking features; it&#x27;s long and swishes with the utmost happiness as she gobbles down the fish, but it boasts beautiful mottled brown markings all the way throughout. Merlin&#x27;s smile only grows as he watches her, and he glances over to see that Arthur&#x27;s expression has softened a little . Well, that&#x27;s probably a good sign. Next, the seemingly contented feline pads around the chambers. Her little pale nose points proudly into the air as she sniffs various objects, and sometimes a large front white paw will extend to bat at anything that takes her interest. She may be a little puffy and look slightly baggy with it, but she moves with grace and dignity all the same. &quot;I think she likes her new home,&quot; Merlin whispers to Arthur through a smirk. The prince chooses to ignore that and rubs at his forehead. He goes to sit on the end of the bed which was apparently stupid move, seeing as it immediately perks the cat&#x27;s interest. She crouches down and then begins to wiggle her backside, her eyes expanding. &quot;Umm, Merlin, what on earth is she—&quot; The cat hurls herself across the room in a second and throws herself across Arthur&#x27;s shoes. Her head shakes happily as she whacks at the laces, making small hissing noises. What&#x27;s most funny, however, is that Arthur looks absolutely terrified. Merlin almost has to try and stop himself from laughing. &quot;She&#x27;s just playing, Arthur,&quot; Merlin reassures, wondrously regarding the feline as she twists and turns her fluffy body, trying to catch the lace that flicks away from her. The prince raises an unconvinced eyebrow as he continues to watch the cat who appears to be in her element, occupying herself with his laces. He can already tell that this is going to be a long night. _______________________ And he wasn&#x27;t wrong. After Arthur had sat on the floor for hours throwing a small ball of twine across the room enough times for the cat to eventually wear herself out, she had admitted to tiredness. She&#x27;d sat for a while as Merlin readied Arthur for bed, making loud licking noises as she groomed her white fur right on top of Arthur&#x27;s desk. Then, after Merlin managed to tear himself away from the new addition for the night, the cat had splayed herself over Arthur&#x27;s desk chair — and, admittedly, the prince had tried not to marvel at the confident way she carries herself as if she owns the room. They&#x27;re quite similar in that respect, but before Arthur could muse about that for much longer, he had fallen asleep. This time, it had been a completely blissful descent into slumber; there&#x27;d been no relentless tapping and scratching at the window, instead being replaced by the gentle and deep purrs of the cat as she twitched contentedly in her sleep. And Arthur would be lying if he said that the relief from saving the sweet thing&#x27;s life didn’t add to the humm of happiness that had accompanied him into sleep. Nevertheless, as the moon shines brightly on another night, Arthur had been woken by a different scratching sound. This time, it was the almost numbed creaky kind of sound. He&#x27;d groaned and sat up, and after a small inspection, found that there were claw marks up one of his bed posts. One of the curtains also hangs half off its rail, and there&#x27;s an assortment of feathered quills strewn across the floor. After sending for Merlin, Arthur sighs and goes to scoop the cat up, managing to catch her as she sprints across the room once more. He doesn&#x27;t really register that&#x27;s what he&#x27;s doing in the oblivion of slumber, but the cat seems okay with it. She looks at him with those bright green eyes, forgiving as Arthur tries to figure out exactly how to hold a cat. Her limbs are surprisingly relaxed after spending what was probably hours hurtling her small weight around. Her tail swishes happily, the mottled fur tickling Arthur&#x27;s arm. Eventually, he finds a position that seems to be comfortable for both of them — with the cat&#x27;s front paws curled over his left shoulder, Arthur supports her behind and her back feet rest easily on his forearm. With the cat starting to calm down in his arms — well, almost, if the way she bites at a loose thread in Arthur&#x27;s shirt is excluded — the price surveys the chambers. All he can think is that he is very glad he just sent for his servant. The damage goes past some scratches to his bed posts and the unravelling of curtains. Cold coals from the fire have been unearthed and are rolled over the floor, leaving behind a scatter of ash — which also matches the smudges of the stuff on the cat&#x27;s white and grey fur. A wardrobe door is wide open with most of his shirts and trousers pulled out of it, and various candle holders have even knocked over on the tables. Arthur sighs as he continues to cradle the bundle of fur, trying to figure out exactly how he slept through all of this. He supposes it must be all of the sleep this very cat had stolen, only, when she was on the other side of the farthest wall. Merlin enters at that moment, and the tiredness that bruises his eyes and purses his lips soon morphs into one of shock and dread. He firmly closes the door behind him and steps forwards as he observes the utter chaos of the room. &quot;What the—&quot; he mutters, raising an eyebrow at Arthur. But he must admit that he caves a little at seeing the previously grumpy prince holding the cat by choice. &quot;It hasn&#x27;t looked like this since that goblin was let loose in here.&quot; Arthur shrugs and holds the cat up so that her back legs stick out on his arm, and her unknowing eyes stare innocently at Merlin. &quot;Well, s she&#x27;s the goblin now.&quot; And then the servant starts to laugh. He isn&#x27;t sure if it&#x27;s the sleep deprivation or the sight of his master holding a fluffy cat, but he goes with the latter as he wholeheartedly chuckles. Arthur huffs and asks him what&#x27;s so funny, and Merlin wipes the tears from his eyes. &quot;It&#x27;s just seeing you getting fond of the cat after all your cursing and grumbling.&quot; The prince rolls his eyes and sets the feline down, leaving her to gracefully walk over to Merlin. She seems a little wary at first, just standing there with her paw held up again, but she soon recognises the scent of her other rescuer. Within seconds she&#x27;s winding her slender frame around Merlin&#x27;s legs, sounding deep purrs. The servant smiles and bends to stroke along the gracious brown stripe. &quot;You&#x27;re cleaning all this mess up,&quot; Arthur announces as he plonks down on the end of the bed, taking a second glance at the scratches on the wood. &quot;And how are we going to explain that to anyone who comes in here?&quot; &quot;First of all, there is no I in this,&quot; Merlin proposes as he carefully steps over the cat. &quot;I may have suggested going to find her, but it was a joint effort and she&#x27;s both of our responsibilies now. I&#x27;ll still run around after you , but you&#x27;re helping out with her where you can.&quot; Arthur huffs and shrugs like a child who has just been told off, finding, for some reason unknown, that he can&#x27;t actually refute Merlin when he has that serious tone. &quot;Right. Good,&quot; Merlin says triumphantly, and then bends down to survey the damage the wood. He frowns at it and then meets Arthur&#x27;s eyes, not missing the way the cat&#x27;s tail bobs past. &quot;As for this, I&#x27;ll ask a carpenter to prepare some new posts. We&#x27;ll just have to do this as we go.&quot; Arthur nods and falls back onto the soft bedding, closing his eyes. After hearing a small thud beside him, he flinches a little at the tickling sensation of whiskers brushing past his forehead and a velvety nose pushing against his temple. Arthur half-opens one eye to see the cat staring down at him with her alarmingly — yet endearingly — large eyes. _________________ The following morning, Merlin is taking a &#x27;chore break&#x27; — which is, as Arthur had not failed to notice, the servant&#x27;s fifth one since rescuing the cat. The prince had told him off at first, but then he soon realised that it was actually an advantage; the good while in which Merlin is entertaining the loving feline, Arthur can finally write some papers without having a puffy cat sitting on the desk, ears perked forwards as a large paw bats at the feather quill. &quot;I think she needs a name. We can&#x27;t just keep calling her &#x27;the cat&#x27;,&quot; Merlin commences in the silence as he smiles fondly at the feline. He glances at Arthur and raises a hopeful brow. &quot;What do you think?&quot; Arthur sighs lightly and takes his attention away from the paper. His focus lands on the way the cat is stretched up Merlin&#x27;s chest, chewing at the scruffy kerchief around his neck. He smiles smugly. At least it isn&#x27;t his clothes getting destroyed this time. &quot;Alright,&quot; he says eventually, standing up and rounding the table. He wanders over and pulls out a chair, sitting opposite the two. &quot;What do you suggest?&quot; Merlin appears thoughtful for a moment, scratching tenderly between the cat&#x27;s light grey ears. &quot;How about ... Leona? It&#x27;s the female version of Leopold which comes from the Old Tongue for &#x27;lion&#x27;.&quot; Arthur appears to think about this for a moment, tilting his head at the way her little nose twitches and her eyes close slowly as she purrs. He reaches forwards and prizes the gentle creature from Merlin, smiling at the way she spreads out over his lap. He tickles her furry belly and watches the cat stretch all four legs out in all directions. &quot;No,&quot; Arthur eventually decides, causing Merlin to roll his eyes. &quot;She&#x27;s much too laidback to be named after a lion.&quot; &quot;She did run up your legs just earlier, but alright then,&quot; Merlin mumbles sarcastically as he leans back into the chair, becoming distracted as he starts to pluck various white hairs from his clothing — he doesn&#x27;t doubt that Gaius would question it later. &quot;You suggest something then.&quot; &quot;What about Cauda? Doesn&#x27;t it mean tail or something?&quot; he asks, trying to ignore the way the cat climbs up his shoulder and starts licking his hair. &quot;Er, yes, I think so,&quot; Merlin says, frowning a little. &quot;Why though?&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m surprised you have to ask,&quot; Arthur says, cupping the cat&#x27;s tail and letting the mottled brown fur brush past his palm. Merlin has to admit that the cat&#x27;s tail boasts the most impressive and beauteous markings he has ever seen in any animal, so he shrugs and nods happily. Over the next few weeks, the three of them somehow manage to find something resembling a routine. It started off with Arthur waking in the morning to find Cauda either curled up on a chair or sprawled across the bed, selfishly taking up half the room with her long legs — a surprising feature for a rather short cat. If she is on the bed, Arthur will open one eye and give her a little wave, but that&#x27;s something he would never do if Merlin was in here. If sleeping on the bed is the case — which, most mornings, it does seem to be, Cauda will blink tiredly, stand up, traipse over to the crook of Arthur&#x27;s arm and flop down. Her white fur will be splayed over the embellished covers, with the hints of light grey and pecan brown markings illuminated in the sneaky streak of morning sunlight that peeks through the gap in the newly-fixed curtains. Merlin will then walk in and plonk the breakfast tray down on the table. The noise and scent of food alerts Cauda&#x27;s impeccable senses and so she trots over, sniffing at the tray and then jumping into Merlin&#x27;s ready arms for a good old scratch. And then the servant will take the additional meat off the tray and empty it into Cauda&#x27;s small metal bowl beside her water dish. The extra meat is something he had spent ages asking the cooks for, and it didn&#x27;t help that he isn&#x27;t best liked in the kitchen quarters anyway, but he had eventually resorted to lying that Arthur needs the protein for his training. They&#x27;d bought that, much to Cauda&#x27;s unknowing enjoyment. Each day is different, obviously, and if Arthur is out training or in council, Merlin will happily stay in Arthur&#x27;s chambers and watch over Cauda. She&#x27;s quite a laid back little thing, quite content to sit on the window ledge swishing her glorious name-sake tail as she watches the people weave around the courtyard. Or she&#x27;ll choose to have a nap wherever she so pleases, such as on tables or on top of the wardrobe — because, yes, that has happened before. But then, especially after a power nap, chaos will start to break lose. Her tail will start flicking from side to side as her eyes expand — a telltale sign that she is about to pounce on whatever takes her interest. Merlin will frown and roll up the belt he&#x27;s polishing, or hide his kerchief, just in case. And then he will watch as Cauda tears around the chambers, throwing her weight over anything and sticking her sharp claws into whatever needs to be detained. Merlin knows it just causes more mess that he has to clean up — because Arthur is yet to hold up his part of the deal — but he allows Cauda to play as she likes, simply because she makes him laugh. With some days being hauntingly dark because of Morgana&#x27;s plotting and the threats that come over the castle, the innocent little bundle of white, grey and brown fur brings such light into his life. The way she leaps into the air to catch floating pieces of dust and the way she will forcefully push her head into Merlin&#x27;s side, demanding fuss that she knows she will get. And Arthur has become a lot more fond of her than he thought he would. Whilst Merlin growing up on a farm has made it normal for chickens or sheep to wander to and from houses, Arthur, on the other hand, isn&#x27;t so used to it. Being a prince, he hasn&#x27;t been around many animals unless he is to go riding or visit the farmers for council reasons — and that has just caused him to think that keeping animals in one&#x27;s living space is abnormal and isn&#x27;t the done thing. Having Cauda has really opened his eyes to that. And, secretly, over the weeks, Arthur has started to look forward to being greeted by Cauda — whether it be by sharp claws and large playful eyes or with a rumbling purr and soft nose, depending on which mood she is in. Sometimes it still feels weird to Arthur — walking into his living quarters to see an uncontrolled little being wander around as they please, causing a raucous whenever they feel like it. But it has started feeling like home. It had been a rather humid and foggy day in April, with the sullen mist creeping through doors and condensing windows. The hearth is lit, but the weather isn&#x27;t even cold — it&#x27;s more of a thick warm fog, like the type that would come before a storm. &quot;I really hope we&#x27;re not going to get any thunder,&quot; Arthur comments as he stuffs some stew into his mouth. He pauses slightly and boops Cauda on the nose. She sits in the chair beside him, seemingly not very fussy at all tonight, if the annoyed expression and the furious tail swishing is anything to go by. &quot;I didn&#x27;t know you were scared of storms,&quot; Merlin comments seriously, holding a plate or armour up to inspect his handiwork. Arthur rolls his eyes as he swallows a bit of bread. &quot;No, you clotpole. That&#x27;s because I&#x27;m not . I was talking about Cauda. Who knows how she&#x27;ll react?&quot; &quot;Alright, alright. Someone&#x27;s tetchy.&quot; Merlin teases as he raises an eyebrow dramatically. And then he pauses, glancing at the cat who is glaring indignantly at him from the short distance away. &quot;Although, not as tetchy as that one over there.&quot; Arthur looks confused for a moment before he realises who Merlin is referring to. His own gaze finds the cat at the very moment she thumps down from the chair and begins lapping at her water bowl furiously. It&#x27;s true — in the last two weeks or so, they&#x27;d both noticed a significant change in Cauda. For starters, it&#x27;s the way she seems to be more irritable, like whacking things that weren&#x27;t even in her way as she walks past, or scratching and biting more aggressively than she did before, or just sitting in the middle of the room giving looks that could kill. Secondly, she seems a lot bigger than she was. Initially, they&#x27;d put it down to getting more hearty and frequent meals as opposed to the odd fish like she must have done in the wild. But it seems a little strange exactly how chunky she had become during that time — especially her stomach that has extended enormously. Not to mention the way she tries to steal Arthur&#x27;s food even if she&#x27;d been given her own just previously. They&#x27;d just brushed her off as being a greedy little thing. Well, not so little, now. The strangest thing is the nest she seems to have created by the head of Arthur&#x27;s bed. Since the beginning of the week, it started off as her residing there whenever she napped or slept the night. And then it went from religiously padding the material down, to dragging various items of Arthur&#x27;s clothing to add to it. It makes for a strange sight for anyone who visits, but neither of them have the heart to move it. Especially because of how territorial she seems to be over it — Arthur&#x27;s arm is vexed Cauda bait if he so much as stretches anywhere near it in his sleep. After Merlin returns from taking the empty dishes to the kitchens, the rain suddenly breaks from the sky. It violently descends outside and loudly thrashes any surface that gets in the way. But the servant, seeing that Arthur and Cauda are perfectly content lounging for a while, excuses himself to go and spend some time with Gaius. In the long while that Merlin is gone, there have been multiple lighting strikes, with the room flashing white without warning. Every time it happens, Arthur&#x27;s attention is brought from the papers and instantly to Cauda. But she only seems a little dazed, before she returns to glaring at the prince from the safety of her nest. It isn&#x27;t until the first rumble of thunder that Cauda shoots up from the bed and yelps. The sound makes Arthur jump and then his heart is racing as he watches the rather plump cat run over to a chair, taking cover underneath it. In the old days, she would have moved so fast that she just looked like a blur of white fur and dark-smudged fur. Arthur sighs and stands from his desk, carefully walking over to the wary cat. He crouches down and whispers to her, but she only continues to stare at him with those wide eyes. The prince just shrugs, knowing that she will not come out any time soon. So, he shuffles backwards to lean against the stone of the fireplace, deciding to wait it out. Eventually, after what seems like an hour at least, and only a few quieter rumbles later, Cauda begins to edge out from under the chair. She moves her front paw in that characteristically wary manner, before padding over to Arthur. She doesn&#x27;t sit on his lap as she used to — instead she just plonks herself beside him, not looking too pleased when he gives her an ear scratch, but not exactly grumbling about it, either. Arthur will generally take that as a win, these days. A few hours later, the storm has not necessarily died down, but the rain has become louder and has been drowning out most of the thunder claps. Cauda doesn&#x27;t seem to mind the rain, so everything is fine once more. Merlin has been back for a while and is sitting reading a random book he had plucked off Arthur&#x27;s bookshelf. The rain is serving as a natural relaxant, invisibly soaking the chambers in a sombre sleepiness. That is, until Cauda starts to meow. The sound pierces through the silence, and she really isn&#x27;t a vocal cat, so Arthur and Merlin give one another a rather alarmed glance. The pudgy feline then begins to move around as if she can&#x27;t quite get comfy, and then she&#x27;s panting. This goes on for a while, with Arthur and Merlin getting increasingly concerned. The cat then starts to lick around her behind, and then she&#x27;s heading back to her nest and flopping down on it. The two friends edge closer to their usually crabby little — large — cat. She doesn&#x27;t protest and seems too tried and distracted for that, and, upon closer inspection, Merlin&#x27;s eyes widen. &quot;What is it?&quot; Arthur panics, almost tearing his hair out. &quot;Will you calm down? You&#x27;ll scare her,&quot; Merlin tuts, shooing Arthur off to get some blankets. When he returns, confused as ever, the servant points to Cauda&#x27;s belly. Other than the fact that it looks as if it might explode at any given moment, there is one other obvious sign that they really should have noticed; her teats are enlarged and probably redder than they should be. &quot;How did we not notice?&quot; Arthur sighs and gently sits on the edge of the bed, only glancing at Merlin&#x27;s dumbfounded expression for a moment before he looks back at Cauda. &quot;Are you saying that she&#x27;s been pregnant this whole entire time we&#x27;ve had her?&quot; &quot;Umm.&quot; Merlin scratches at the back of his neck, before tucking in the extra blankets beneath Cauda as gently as he can. &quot;Yes?&quot; &quot;It explains everything,&quot; Arthur mumbles after a few moments, shrugging. &quot;But, er ... how exactly do we do this?&quot; &quot;Well, it might shock you, Arthur, but you&#x27;re not actually the one birthing these kittens, are you?&quot; Merlin jokes which results in Arthur smacking him around the head. He rolls his eyes. &quot;I don&#x27;t know, do I? I suppose with the livestock in Ealdor, we sort of just left them to it and observed them in case anything went wrong.&quot; And so, as the rain becomes louder and the storm descends, they wait — Arthur sits beside Cauda at the head of the bed, and Merlin slouches against a bed post with his legs stretched out. The cat only goes through waylaid cycles of resting, licking, and panting a little. The two soon begin to become restless since they have no idea what a safe cat labour looks like, and worried glances have been shared. Until about half an hour later, the first kitten is born. A thin sac covers it, which Cauda quickly tears off so the kitten can breathe. Its tiny all-grey body wiggles around helplessly, letting out the occasional squeaky mew . Cauda then gently pushes the kitten toward her belly and it suckles gratefully whilst she vigorously licks her young to keep it warm. As Arthur watches the exchange, he almost feels as if he is an intruder to such a naturally loving moment. But then again, she&#x27;d be having these kittens in a cold storm if it weren&#x27;t for their rescue, so he feels obliged to stay. But no — Arthur knows who really deserves the praise. He nudges Merlin&#x27;s arm and nods at him with a smile, bringing the servant out of wiping happy tears from his eyes. &quot;This is all on you, my friend. Without you, who knows what could have happened.&quot; Merlin just shakes his head humbly and smiles shyly. &quot;No, her rescue was down to both of us—&quot; &quot;Oh, don’t be so modest, Merlin,&quot; Arthur says, smiling as he watches the little kitten squeak, its eyes closed on its tiny head. Not long after, another kitten is born — this time, they&#x27;re a darker grey with white paws. Two placentas come shortly after, and as the two little siblings come to one with the world, the third arrives with its placenta. This one is pure white, much like its mother but without the brown and grey markings. Merlin can&#x27;t really hold the sniffles back as he slowly offers more blankets to Cauda. When she hisses at him and nudges her young closer, he gets the message and leaves the cotton beside the larger cat. The night goes on like that with the rain muffled outside and intermittent squeaks from three tiny kittens a haven to all ears in the room. When the miraculous event is over, Cauda rests easy, with her three kittens shuffling around and over one another, their limbs clumsy and fragile. Arthur and Merlin find themselves completely in awe and in a state of surrealism; they&#x27;d never have guessed that after rescuing the small creature and growing attached to the chaos she&#x27;d caused, that they&#x27;d be sitting here looking at her as she fusses over her young. ____________________ The next few months are even more eventful than Merlin and Arthur had anticipated. They&#x27;d had to bring in another steel basin as a litter tray as the three kittens slowly learn to use it and copy their mother&#x27;s example. In the first three weeks, they had been rather quiet, sleeping most of the time with Cauda lying with them for as long as she could. Arthur and Merlin had been careful to give the new mother distance, instead thinking it best that she is given peace to bond with her young. They&#x27;d observed from a distance, until about two week ago when Cauda had stopped being so protective. Arthur had felt incredibly wary the first few times he held one of the kittens, or even when he just touched it gently. Being used to pushing the knights around and slapping Merlin round the head, the prince has had to get used to being a lot more gentle. At first, he had observed the way Merlin held one with the utmost patience and kindness, and then he&#x27;d decided to give it a go himself. He&#x27;d chosen the most confident kitten — the second born, with the grey and white smudges. It had seemed quite interested in sniffing him when it wobbled over in a daze, with Arthur helping it walk when it toppled over a few times — especially if Cauda is busy doting on another shaky and unsure kitten. So, as it staggered over to him, Merlin had given him an enthusiastic nod, and he&#x27;d finally done it. His heart had begun racing as he realised just how small and fragile this little kitten was under his strong fingers. Its short grey and white fur, only beginning to start growing, was soft beneath his calloused skin. It had wiggled a little at first but soon relaxed when it learned to trust Arthur. The prince almost had tears in his eyes as he considered just how absolutely tiny this little being was. That kitten seemed to have taken a shine to Arthur, from that day. And, with it being the most confident kitten and being quite happy to be held up, they&#x27;d successfully sexed it after quiet bouts of &#x27;Arthur, it&#x27;s a boy. I&#x27;m telling you!&#x27; and &#x27;No, Merlin, it&#x27;s a girl!&#x27; As it turns out, Merlin was right, and he&#x27;d given Arthur the chance to name this one seeing as the two seem to be so fond of one another. The prince had gently scooped the kitten up and taken him over to the other side of the chambers where he could decide in peace — decidedly without having Merlin cooing loudly at the other two every second. Arthur had looked at the kitten&#x27;s ocean blue eyes and the way it slowly blinks at him as if he is trying to decipher everything about him. The little thing boasts beautiful dark grey fur a little like his mother, but he has more, with smudges of white and soft albino paws. His coat is smooth and sleek, and he has the most stoic face. Personality wise, he seems a feisty little thing, often being the first out of the three to pounce on something or take an interest in it. So, Arthur had, between bouts of smiling like an idiot at the kitten and trying to get him to stop biting his hand with its sword-sharp teeth, declared its name to be Leo, in the spirit of a lion. Merlin had seemed perfectly happy with that choice, of course, having initially wanted to name Cauda after such a thing. Merlin was the next to name one. The first-born — the one with light grey covering his little wriggly body head to toe — is the most wary of them all. She seems entirely curious and very intelligent for such a wobbly thing; she&#x27;s always behind her siblings when they&#x27;re discovering something new — most recently, the three had gone on a great quest to find out why Arthur&#x27;s wardrobe squeaks every time it&#x27;s opened. The light grey kitten had stayed behind and carefully surveyed the strange object, before padding her furry ashen-coloured paws forwards. She isn&#x27;t too affectionate, often preferring to bound off with her siblings and start tumble fights beneath Arthur&#x27;s bed, but she will quite happily allow a stroke. With her wondrous independence for only a three- month kitten, Merlin had decided on Maude — an Old English name with roots to war and bravery. And then, there&#x27;s the runt of the litter. The third-born, all white little thing. He&#x27;s entirely sweet and always stops scratching and biting at Merlin and Arthur&#x27;s hands when they wince. He has those large blue eyes and a dopey head tilt, with a very active swishing tale much like his mother&#x27;s, even if it is still thin and short. He carries himself with grace rarely, often preferring to run before he can walk and trip over things. But personality aside, his pure colour had given him the name Alphius, stemming from the ancient roots of language, simply meaning &#x27;white&#x27;. Arthur had joked that Alphius takes after Merlin with the clumsiness, and the servant had retorted by throwing a ball of twine at the prince. Needless to say that he was soon pounced on by a flurry of three energetic kittens and the large fluffy mother cat who seemed more than happy to teach her young how to attack Arthur. Merlin had snickered at the sight. From then on, the months get busier. With Morgana’s relentless plotting, the threats to Camelot never really cease, and Merlin feels as if he’s always dashing this way and that. But miraculously – and he honestly still doesn’t know exactly how – Merlin still has time at the end of the day for the four felines. Gaius had just begin to question the lengthy visits he is taking to Arthur’s chambers, and Merlin is sure that the Physician is no longer buying his excuse of more chores and work never stopping. But Merlin can’t help it; a few nights ago, just to see if he actually could , he had taken the entire day off and hadn’t seen any of the cats in a whole day. And, well, he’d tossed and turned in his bed until he begun to feel strange without having four bundles of energy hurling around him. So, he’d waltzed into Arthur’s chambers – ignoring the way the guards stared at the spring in his step – and immediately, he’d felt four bodies of soft fur plummet into his chest. Arthur had woken, stared at the laughing servant, and then groaned and rolled back over. Miraculously, these cats had proved as a turning point in Arthur’s mind. Since February, for about six months, Arthur had come to see that the furry and friendly beings on legs are no harbingers of doom. And no more than two weeks ago, he had announced to Merlin that when he becomes King – which isn’t too far away, given Uther’s declining health – he will lift the ban on cats. But the servant had argued that it might look odd, excusing cats but still leaving sorcerers to be persecuted. Arthur was then prompted into a musing that carried on for weeks – even the weeks past Morgana’s final betrayal and confinement to her hovel. If cats aren’t so bad, then who says that sorcerers are? And then Arthur asked Merlin to fetch some sorcerers. Even Maude had given him a strange look as she sat there swishing her tail. Merlin had been so shocked that he had just gaped at Arthur, not even protesting when Alphius and Leo climbed onto his shoulders to eat his hair. The servant had asked why as he prized the cats down, and the prince had announced that that he was willing to consider the true nature of sorcerers. Merlin would have just continued to stare at Arthur – that’s if Cauda hadn’t ambled over and whacked him with a very confident paw as if to snap him into reality. And then, as the servant frowned at Cauda for her behaviour, he had looked into those innocent eyes and considered her stockier build. He’d thought back to when she was just a small, uncertain rescue cat. Eventually, in that long moment of staring at the cat, he had come to see that if Cauda could win Arthur over despite her feared associations to sorcery, then perhaps it was his chance. ‘’Umm, well … uhh … there’s one right here,’’ Merlin had whispered, heart racing as he cuddled Cauda closer to him for reassurance. The bundle of fur had started licking his chin and batting at his kerchief once more, like she had done when she was as young as her kittens. Arthur had only frowned and pointed half-heartedly at the cat. ‘’Cauda is not a sorcerer, Merlin. I think you need to get some sleep–‘’ ‘’No,’’ the servant had hoarsely interjected, his voice deeper these days, gripping the feline tighter and feeling her fur peek through his fingers. ‘’I mean … me. I – I’m a sorcerer, Arthur.’’ The prince had sat for a long while, eyes wide and jaw almost on the floor, not even registering Alphius when he pounced on his lap. He’d blinked once at his servant, not entirely believing that the clumsy man could actually possess magic – and for all these years, too. His heart had begun to race as he considered Merlin’s wisdom and courage, and then it all made sense. Merlin had lifted a shaky hand and preformed a spell to make the cats’ ball of twine – the fourteenth one they’d had to replace in the five years – roll across the room. All four felines sprinted towards it, with Leo skidding across the floor with the way his vigour, making various hisses and crashing sounds. Arthur had realised that if Merlin was going to harm anyone, he’d have done it by now. And so, as the cats continued to grow – well, the younger ones anyway, with Cauda’s growth ceasing a while ago once she became a senior cat – Arthur had come round to acceptance. Unfortunately, it came too late for Morgana, who had continued to start war after war, too spiralled in hatred and bitterness to come back to Camelot like they had all hoped. Not too long after Uther died, about four months ago, Arthur and the others had been holding weekly meetings, vowing to lift the magic ban slowly and steadily. Today, they’re having their first ever Round Table meeting, with Gwen interjecting that they can’t exactly all sit around the rather small one in Arthur’s chambers anymore. Despite the magic ban being lifted and the cats being allowed free reign of the castle, they always seem to pile into the chambers when it’s time for a council meeting. This had lead to all of the knights getting distracted by the cats and actually finding it very difficult to concentrate on whatever they were discussing. Maude had taken a liking to chewing at Gwaine’s hair whenever she was stealthy enough to sneak past anyone and jump onto the chair. Alphius, whilst still sweet and rather gentle, still doesn’t really know how fluffy he actually is and always proceeds to plonk himself in front of Leon, having taken quite a shine to him for some reason. His white fur will be splayed all over the maps, batting the markers and quills every so often. Leo prefers to creep around underneath the table, stalking the Knight’s shoes and tirelessly trying to eat their laces and ankles. He never goes for Percival’s, assumingly because his feet are too big and therefore an easy target, but he quite likes to go for Lancelot and Elyan’s legs, knowing that those two Knights are way too kind to shoo him away. Cauda, however, in her older age, will simply curl up on Merlin’s lap and watch her young cause chaos with quite an unamused expression. So, here the eight of them are – including Gwen and Gaius – situated around a bright mahogany table that takes up at least a quarter of the Council Hall. They’d been discussing types of magic most likely to be used with malice toward Camelot, and the conversation had been flowing nicely for the last hour or so. That is, until, Gaius lets out a gasp of surprise as a furry thing on legs jumps up onto the table beside him. Merlin simply chuckles, whilst Arthur fumes. The Knights snicker among themselves at Maude’s timely interruption, and Gwen balls a bit of paper up to throw across the table for the four-year-old cat’s amusement. That only makes Merlin laugh harder and he gives Gwen a friendly and approving wink, which causes Arthur’s face to become redder. It’s fair to say that he takes lifting this magic ban and undoing his father’s barbaric work very seriously , and no cat – no matter how much he dotes on them – will stop it from happening. That’s more than evident in the way Arthur barks at Merlin to take the cat out of the hall. The servant rolls his eyes and stands from his chair to gently grab the grey feline, only for her to think it’s a game and hurl around the table. She ends up pushing all the papers away, sending them floating to the stone floor, as she leaps into Lancelot’s arms. The Knight gives Maude a tender rub behind the ears as he holds her to him, chuckling proudly at the way he has managed to worm his way into the aloof cat’s affections. Merlin simply shrugs and smirks at an unamused Arthur, just as Alphius happily strolls into the room, trotting with his fur bobbing along and tail swishing contentedly. He sounds a very loud and off-key meww – something Gwaine had taught him on their first meeting when he’d tried to badly and inharmoniously impersonate a cat, causing everyone to either cover their ears or leave the room. He plonks himself on Leon’s lap, of course, and the blonde knight smiles and gives the sweet cat a belly scratch. The meetings go on like this for a few more months until the ban and relentless persecution of magic is successfully lifted in Camelot, promising fair and thorough judgements to all. Word of Morgana’s demise reaches Camelot, and then the years of golden harvests and bare winters whirl by. Gwen becomes Queen, and Albion is born. All sorts of magical creatures are free in the grounds of Camelot, as, of course, are each and every cat. Some say that the Kingdom looks completely ridiculous now with all of this going on, but Arthur and the members of the round table couldn’t be prouder of everything they have achieved. Of course, the real gratitude must go to Cauda. Eleven years ago, she had woken Arthur from his slumber too many times and had then found herself a permanent residency as a loving chamber cat. The two men had hidden her secretly – and the realisation of that to everyone else had suddenly come down on them, as they recalled the hairs in the chambers and constant scratching by the cupboard door. Most importantly, Cauda and her three delightful furry kittens had birthed Albion. It still sounds absolutely ludicrous, but everyone hates to think what their happy Kingdom would have turned into if it hadn’t been for Cauda’s rescue. But they are all forced to say a very painful goodbye to the happy-go-lucky cat when, one winter, she starts to slow down, and then one night just after the winter Solstice, she passes peacefully in her sleep. It’s a raw and heavy moment for everyone – especially Arthur and Merlin who still see her little innocent eyes looking up at them, or the relentless crashes of night time play, or the sweet joy of seeing her bond with her three young. Cauda was buried with her favourite ball of twine, and all of the Round Table members had shared a sniffle or a gutful sob as the soil piled up and as the stone was marked in the ground. The three young cats had simply sat, tails still on the cold ground, as their curious yet sad little eyes watched on. At one point, Alphius had begged Leon to pick him up which the knight had instantly done, cradling the bundle of white fur to his chest. Maude had loyally gone and sat between Merlin and Lancelot, with Leo perched on Arthur’s shoulder – at least that had evoked a few sombre laughs of levity from a few folk. But then, as it always does, time had gone on. The three furry siblings felt strange as their paws padded back onto stone that their mother was never to grace again, and Arthur and Merlin’s hearts were heavy. But, as they pushed through the sore grief, they vowed to keep living for the people of their Kingdom and for the sake of Cauda’s honour. Eventually, summer rolls around, and one evening, the three smallish cats sit in a complying trio of fur along a stone wall. Merlin stands behind them, scratching at each of their ears that are illuminated in different shades beneath the golden sun. They watch Arthur converse with a magical farmer about taxes, with a boundless dragon at his feet. Merlin smiles at the sight, but all the whilst remembering the words carved into Cauda’s gravestone.</span> <a href="#" class="summary-toggle">[ + ]</a></div><div class="stats"><div class="stat-item"><strong>Rating:</strong> General Audiences</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Archive Warning:</strong> Choose Not To Use Archive Warnings</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Fandom:</strong> Merlin (TV)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Relationship:</strong> Merlin/Arthur Pendragon (Merlin), Gwen &amp; Merlin (Merlin), Knights of the Round Table &amp; Merlin (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Character:</strong> Merlin (Merlin), Arthur Pendragon (Merlin), Leon (Merlin), Lancelot (Merlin), Gwen (Merlin), Morgana (Merlin), Gaius (Merlin), Gwaine (Merlin), Elyan (Merlin), Percival (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Additional Tags:</strong> Merthur with a pet cat, The knights and cats, it&#x27;s adorable, I cried whilst writing this, Albion, Furry felines overrun in Camelot, Lancelot Lives, magic reveals</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Published:</strong> 2021-05-02</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Words:</strong> 8807</div></div></div><div class="work-entry"><h2 class="title"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://download.archiveofourown.org/downloads/10837860/Charmed%20Meets%20Merlin.pdf?updated_at=1495150266" target="_blank">Charmed Meets Merlin: Arthur</a></h2><div class="summary"><span class="summary-short">Arthur had returned.

Piper was trying to like him, for Merlin&#x27;s sake, but it wasn&#x27;t easy. (Set after Charmed Meets Merlin: Tea, but you could probably figure it out without reading that one) Notes See the end of the work for notes Arthur came back. He had some twenty-odd years of modern knowledge to go with his thirty-odd years of ancient knowledge. He had blond hair to rival Wyatt&#x27;s, eyes bluer than whitelighter orbs, and a temper that was vaguely, insultingly familiar. He looked so young it made Piper furious. If men who were thousands of years old could look like her children (or way younger siblings, maybe), then what chance did she have of looking young? Seriously. Why did she even bother with creams or anything? Still, her insecurities aside, Arthur was a nice enough man, and since Merlin was homeless unless he stayed at the manor, she found him stopping by increasingly frequency. And that was fine. She just. Had had to give him the talk. It went well, she supposed, mainly with her trying to threaten him subtly and ending up threatening him overtly. “Listen.” She&#x27;d said quietly, Merlin in the next room. “A lot of people I love have magic. Including my sons. Merlin tells me you don&#x27;t hunt witches anymore, but just in case you get any bright ideas...” She&#x27;d flicked her hand at a vase (she&#x27;d been meaning to throw it out anyway) and watched as Arthur&#x27;s eyes widened, his whole frame flinching at the explosion. To drive it home, she&#x27;d grinned at him. “Are we clear?” While he&#x27;d nodded at the time, making multiple assurances he would never hurt her children, she understood how that sort of conversation could put a dent in any relationship. That was fine. Piper had threatened to vanquish King Arthur, but it was fine. Strangely, that felt like the only part of this situation that held any normalcy – making sure, above all, that her family was safe. God, though, she&#x27;d threatened a mythical hero. To his face . She hoped Merlin never, never ever found out about it. But Merlin was very busy nowadays. He&#x27;d explained it to her many times – something about dragons coming back, rampaging all over England, and him and Arthur being the only ones who could save the day – but Piper only really got the gist of it. Merlin was...not always the best communicator. He liked to rant on and on about different magical things that often Piper had never heard of, and honestly it&#x27;s always a toss up on whether he was messing with her, or these were real creatures he&#x27;d fought before. So. She gave it fifty-fifty odds that he&#x27;d actually been fighting dragons for the past few months. Sorry, corralling dragons. Still, he dropped by for tea every few weeks like usual, and since he kept visiting, so did Arthur. Arthur was...weird. Having two sets of memories jammed into one&#x27;s head must be strange (or even one really big set, like Merlin), and it showed. She could actually pinpoint the moment Arthur went from pampered, rich, corporate business- man&#x27;s son to tough general, soldier and king. His back straightened, his hands locked behind his back, and his chin raised. He&#x27;d don this mask, too, of calm and confidence and strength. Every time, she expected someone to start waving a flag behind him, and him to start barking orders at cadets. It was weird . His other persona, the one where he wore thousand-dollar shoes and snorted at texts on the latest smartphone and wrinkled his nose at traveling somewhere in anything not a limo or a jet, was even weirder. Piper knew that her family was well-off. She had a business, after all, and though she&#x27;d inherited the manor, she still knew that it was a friggin manor (even though it took serious money to fix everything all the time, so she&#x27;d probably already paid for it in repairs). The Halliwells were well off. But the Pendragons were Bruce Wayne, Batman cartoon super-hero, could-roll-around-in-their- money rich . Richy rich rich. She doubted Merlin had noticed. Her warlock friend was confused enough with the different currencies around the world, and the one time she&#x27;d tried to explain inflation to him, he&#x27;d set her attic on fire. Honestly, sometimes it was a miracle that he remembered he even needed to pay money for things. He probably stole way more often than he bought. Hopefully, with his new, unbelievably wealthy friend by his side, all the places Merlin frequented would start getting their money back. But where was she? Oh, right. Arthur was rich. He was nice. He was dangerous. He was beginning to get on her nerves. Didn&#x27;t that always happen? Friends of friends usually made for pleasant acquaintances at best , mostly ending up as that-person-that-I-have-to-pretend-to-like-in-front-of-my-friend. And Piper was not that great at pretending. Still, she tried, after answering the door to reveal not an irritating blond but a welcome warlock – she smiled wide and tried not to show how relieved she was. “Merlin! Come on in.” “Hello, Piper.” He stepped in and, as now was custom, gently wrapped an arm around her. Piper knew he needed this. She wasn&#x27;t a real touchy sort of person, not outside her immediate family, but she let him hug her and hoped that it helped. “I just pulled some brownies out of the oven.” She said against his shoulder (why must every man she meets be so much taller than her?). “We could have some with our tea, if you want.” He breathed out slowly, a warm breeze on her hair, and nodded. “Okay.” It took another moment for him to let her go, which was honestly about all she could handle before she blew something up. Maybe she could cuddle more with her husband or her sisters, but she had to have a limit somewhere. “Um...Piper.” He said later in the parlor, suddenly shy as he munched his brownie and sipped at his tea. “I&#x27;ve been meaning to talk to you. A-about Arthur.” Piper tried not to freeze. He hadn&#x27;t found out about the threat thing, had he? Maybe if she gave him another hug, he&#x27;d forgive her. Er...two hugs? “What about Arthur?” She asked. Her tone was casual, but she couldn&#x27;t help rolling her shoulders, like she was preparing for a fight, and she cursed her instincts. Merlin didn&#x27;t notice. “You...you like him, don&#x27;t you?” Piper couldn&#x27;t help but snort. She coughed, to cover it up. “Uh. Well... It doesn&#x27;t matter what I think.” She said honestly. “He&#x27;s your friend. It only matters what you think.” Merlin looked like she&#x27;d given him the worst answer imaginable – his brow bunched up, his hands twisted together, and his mouth frowned hard. “Yes but – but I want you to be friends with him. Too. You&#x27;re both..” He blinked away some strong emotion. “You&#x27;re both my friends. I-I want you to get along.” He stared at her with those sad baby blues, and Piper knew immediately that Wyatt was going to get away with a lot in the future. Demons she could handle. Pathetic pouts? She was apparently powerless against them. Piper sighed. “You like him. So I&#x27;m trying to like him, Merlin. We just – don&#x27;t have anything in common. So it&#x27;s hard.” Merlin blinked again, then smiled. “Don&#x27;t be stupid, Piper,” He said, his old-man voice coming back a bit. “You have at least one thing in common – you&#x27;ve got me.” Dammit. He was right. Piper sighed a second time. “I guess we&#x27;ll just talk about you for the rest of our conversations together.” Merlin shrugged. “It&#x27;s a starting place. Besides,” He grinned wryly, “It&#x27;s still slightly better than talking about the weather.” “Don&#x27;t count on it.” “Merlin isn&#x27;t here.” Piper said a few weeks later, when she opened the door to a familiar blond man. It was rude. She should at least say hello or something. She didn&#x27;t. “Er. Alright.” Arthur said back, awkward as ever with her. “He said he&#x27;d be here later today. Is it – is it alright if I wait? Inside?” God, did he have to? Piper hesitated, hand tight on the door, one second away from telling him to wait in his fancy limo and slamming the door in his face. It would be very satisfying. Still, Piper remembered her conversation with Merlin awhile ago, and her conscience frowned disapprovingly at her. Somedays she hated having a big heart. “Yeah.” She sighed. “Come on in, Arthur.” It was difficult to let him pass her, a tentative smile on his face, but she just pictured Merlin and his puppy dog eyes and it became a lot easier. For Merlin . “You can wait in the living room, if you want.” Piper told him. The door closing behind her felt like the final nail in this awkward interaction coffin. At least Arthur didn&#x27;t try to hang up his coat, which would be a sure sign he planned to stay long. Hopefully, they could make innocent small talk for a short time and Merlin would show up not ten minutes from now. Hopefully. “I don&#x27;t have any tea ready, but uh, I could brew some. If you want.” Piper tried. Unfortunately, Merlin was not known for his punctuality. “Oh, you don&#x27;t need to go to any trouble –” Arthur started. “It&#x27;s not really trouble –” “Well, I don&#x27;t mean to intrude –” “You&#x27;re not –” “If you&#x27;re sure –” “Let&#x27;s just sit down.” Piper finally said. Sort of yelled it, actually. It felt like they were playing some weird, polite, passive-aggressive tennis match, and it was irking the hell out of her. Because she was losing. They lumbered to the living room, Arthur situating himself on her flowery couch, his current outfit probably worth more than her car, and Piper sitting in the armchair across from him. It was too bad Wyatt&#x27;s at preschool and Chris&#x27;s napping, she thought, or she could have a legitimate excuse to leave Arthur in here alone. The silence stretched. “So. Merlin.” Piper said, unable to take it. “How is he?” “You see him more than I do.” Arthur muttered. His blue eyes widened when he realized he&#x27;d said that aloud, and that Piper&#x27;d heard. “I-I mean, he&#x27;s fine. He&#x27;s already made friends with five dragons.” Piper eyed Arthur. He smiled blandly back, but she saw a bead of sweat on his brow. At least they were both not enjoying this. “That&#x27;s good. Have you guys finally gotten that situation under control?” She asked. She was genuinely curious, if only because Arthur was easier to read and had no crazy-babble that she had to translate. Merlin told her these things, but she didn&#x27;t understand them. “Um..It goes well. We&#x27;ve almost located the wizard that summoned all these dragons.” Arthur said. “It seems he wanted an unstoppable army of the creatures, but..” He scratched his cheek. “He couldn&#x27;t control them?” Piper guessed. “Well, yes.” “Ah.” That lapsed into uncomfortable quiet once more. Arthur couldn&#x27;t seem to bring himself to lean back on her couch, as if that would be too informal for him. He sat ramrod straight instead, tapping a finger on his knee nervously. It irked her. Of course, she recognized that she would hate it if he lounged over her furniture, and that her annoyance stemmed not from his posture but from the awkward situation. Still, her irritation didn&#x27;t stop. Piper searched deep inside herself for every scrap of patience she possessed, and tried to start another conversation. “So do you live in America now?” Arthur looked startled. “Pardon?” “I just wondered if you&#x27;d moved to the US or you still lived in England.” She clarified, her smile turning brittle. “Because flying over here every week doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;d be much fun.” “Oh, uh,” Arthur blinked. “I have a house here. But I&#x27;m at the estate in London more nights than not.” Wow. Richy rich rich . It took Arthur a moment to realize that his words were a bit pretentious and he turned red, but didn&#x27;t correct himself. But Piper found herself caught up in another detail. “You have a house here?” She frowned. “Then why doesn&#x27;t Merlin hang out over there?” Arthur raised an eyebrow at her. “Yeah, I know he likes to visit me,” She fumbled, “I just mean why do you two have to meet up here , instead of there ? Or better yet, your place in London! He can teleport.” Looking down at his hands, which had callouses only recently from his adventures, Piper assumed, Arthur sighed. “Merlin...has changed.” He didn&#x27;t meet her eyes. It was a tender, humanizing moment, and it stilled Piper&#x27;s sarcastic tongue. She waited for him to continue rather than rushing to defend her friend. “Once, he would say that his place is always by my side. But now.” Arthur furrowed his brow. “Now he needs his space. He can&#x27;t – he can&#x27;t seem to be near me. For too long. It. Confuses him.” Piper didn&#x27;t understand. This was what Merlin had wanted for centuries , what he&#x27;d been waiting and craving for. And from what she&#x27;d seen of Merlin, and Merlin and Arthur together, the warlock had seemed so happy and at peace . Yet Arthur was saying that Merlin couldn&#x27;t handle it. “What do you mean?” Piper wondered. Arthur finally met her eyes, and he looked incredibly sad. “Piper, Merlin is very old. Even with his resilience and his magic, his mind is not what is once was. And – and he seems to think I can&#x27;t handle it.” Arthur smiled without warmth. “He&#x27;s trying to hide the worst of it from me. That&#x27;s why he won&#x27;t stay at my home, I think. He&#x27;s afraid I&#x27;ll see the, the damage, and – I dunno. Run away, I suppose.” “Would you?” “No!” Arthur burst out. It was the first time Piper had ever seen him angry. “No, of course not! He&#x27;s still my friend. I wouldn&#x27;t fault him for losing an arm, or-or being blind, why would I fault him for this? It&#x27;s not like he&#x27;s this way on purpose!” Piper was speechless. She&#x27;d known that Merlin wasn&#x27;t in the best mental health for ages, even before his breakdown at the lake. She&#x27;d heard him call her so many other names – Gwen, Morgana, Mother, Arthur, (only the last one had bothered her, since it wasn&#x27;t even female , come on) – and she knew Merlin hadn&#x27;t the foggiest what year it was, even on a good day. She did know. Still, she hadn&#x27;t even thought about what Merlin might&#x27;ve been before, and how much of a loss it might be to see how he&#x27;d changed. And Arthur did grieve. He was torn up about Merlin and his mind and it showed. But. But there was still so much love and care wound up in it, as if half of his grief was the pain Merlin&#x27;s mental instability caused Merlin . It left Piper speechless, in a very very good way. “Maybe you should tell him all that.” She said softly. Arthur was still red in the face, from embarrassment or strong emotion she wasn&#x27;t sure, and had to consciously release tightened fists in his lap. He tilted his lips up at her voice. “Maybe I should.” He agreed. “But Merlin is...stubborn. It&#x27;s difficult for anything to penetrate that thick skull of his, especially the fact that I consider him family.” Piper stopped and considered this man, this king, this friend of a friend. “Try a hug.” She suggested. “That worked for me.” Arthur considered her right back. He nodded. There came a familiar knock at the door (Merlin was still polite even though she&#x27;d told him he could just zap right on in now), and the pair in the living room exchanged fond grins. When Piper stood to get the door, though, Arthur caught her arm. “I don&#x27;t think I ever said but – thank you.” He told her. “For looking after him.” “You&#x27;re welcome. Uh, I know I never said but,” Piper pushed a lock of hair behind her ear. “Sorry for threatening you before.” Arthur actually laughed. “You&#x27;re quite forgiven.” And the awkward silences were back, though not quite as uncomfortable as before. Piper found that Merlin was right – she and Arthur had at least one thing in common. Since it was Merlin, it was enough. When Merlin entered her house that day, he was greeted with two hugs. He cried. Mainly, he insisted, because his two best friends were finally becoming friends. Piper refused to hug Arthur, they weren&#x27;t there yet, but. Still. It was a start.

Notes enjoy modern merlin and arthur being a chaotic duo as usual! :) See the end of the work for more notes “You were you, and I was I; We were two before our time. I was yours before I knew, and you have always been mine too.” -Lang Leav “Kayaking?” Arthur suggested. “No.” “Yoga?” At that, Arthur shot Merlin an incredulous look from over the screen of his laptop the same time his fiance giggled, knowing he got the reaction he wanted. “You wouldn’t, by any chance, be interested in blind sculpting, would you?” Merlin had the nerve to look the slightest bit interested before Arthur threw a pillow at him. He didn’t move to block it, which satisfied Arthur. “Alright, that’s enough online searching for you.” Arthur mused, pulling Merlin’s laptop over to him and slamming it shut. “Well, it is not like your royal arse came up with the best idea.” Merlin said, crossing his arms over his chest. Arthur was still scrolling down, carefully scanning the pictures and words on the screen in front of him. They had been looking for new activities to do in New York once they got here. They did everything a tourist would do on their first time here, and they were running out of new things to try. It was a difficult task since the two of them were picky, but as Arthur stumbled across an interesting idea, the corner of his lips lifted up in the smallest of a smirk. He followed the online booking instructions he was reading, not saying anything about what he had just found. “You know what I had in mind, and it is the best idea.” Arthur teased, his eyes not leaving the screen. He heard Merlin talking from behind his hands that probably covered his face. “For the last time, Arthur, we’re not going down to an art museum and making out in front of every painting there.” Arthur smiled to himself and shut down his device, turning his full attention to Merlin. “No one will be looking at them.” He shrugged, putting his hand out to Merlin in the small space that separated them on the bed of their hotel room. Merlin took it. “That’s exactly the point!” he exclaimed, his cheeks tinted pink. It amused Arthur how much this topic was driving him up the wall. He pulled Merlin’s hand and in one swift movement, he was on top of Arthur. “Well, if you think about it how I do,” he smirked, slowly pulling him down by the collar of his shirt. He was wearing a simple black cotton shirt that clung to his finely defined muscles. Merlin’s eyes went down to Arthur’s lips for a split second before they went back to his, clearly struggling to stay annoyed. “ We’ll be the art.” Arthur mumbled, speaking quietly on purpose, nudging his nose with Merlin’s but still not making a move. Merlin’s shirt was still fisted in his hand, and he could feel the heat that radiated off of him as he hovered barely inches away over him. “I hate you.” Merlin whispered, smiling ever so faintly before his lips came down onto Arthur’s in a devouring kiss. Arthur’s grip on Merlin’s shirt went loose and instead they went up to his face. They easily synced together as if this was as easy and as effortless as breathing. Fire erupted inside Arthur, tingling his hands as they tangled themselves in Merlin’s soft, black hair. A low sound escaped Arthur’s throat when he felt Merlin’s hands slide down his chest, heading towards the hem of his shirt before he abruptly stopped moving, breaking their kiss. He watched as Merlin casually rolled off of him and laid back next to him, resting his head back on his hands. Arthur was panting, still burning with heat. He propped himself on his elbows, an incredulous look on his face. “ What was that?” Arthur snapped, confused and frustrated. In more than a way. Merlin’s eyes were closed and he had a faint content expression on his face. “What?” he simply asked, not bothering to open his eyes nor to break the smug look on his face. “Is this how we leave things now?” Arthur was fighting not to kiss that irritating yet hot look on Merlin’s face away. “If you’re planning on pissing me off more often, yeah.” He was smirking now. Arthur was about to snap at him before he relaxed, coming up with an excellent way to get back at him. “Is that so?” “Yes, it is so.” “Fine.” Arthur smiled, mimicking Merlin’s position next to him. Their lifted elbows rubbed against each other. “Then I’m not telling you what we’re doing for tomorrow.” “You did, and I clearly told you–” “I’m serious.” Arthur cut him off. Arthur felt the weight of the bed shift next to him as Merlin moved. He peeked one eye open to steal a glance at Merlin who had sat up, shooting him an accusing look. “You found something? And you’re not telling me ?!” He nearly yelled. “If you’re planning on pissing me off more, no, I’m not telling you.” Arthur fully opened his eyes to indulge in the expression that was forming on Merlin’s face. “Brat.” Merlin shot, yanking the pillow Arthur was resting on from under his head and slamming it down on Arthur full force. Arthur, whose body was technically centuries old now, easily caught the feather-filled weapon halfway in the air and tossed it away, angering Merlin even more. “Wrong word.” Arthur teased, wiggling his eyebrows at Merlin. “Arthur Pendragon, you’re telling me where and what we’re doing tomorrow.” Merlin said, glaring at him. “You’re going to have to make me.” Arthur sat up, resting his back against the headboard. He watched as Merlin closed his eyes and blew out a breath in frustration. He leaned closer to Arthur and pecked his lips. Arthur looked at him thoughtfully, “I could use a little more convincing.” Merlin looked like he wanted to very much strangle Arthur, but instead he leaned in and kissed him again, this time a little longer than before. It was the sort of kiss that ended right before it started being a really good one. When Arthur stayed silent, Merlin raised his eyebrows as if to say “seriously?”. Arthur only grinned. Merlin poured his exasperation into their third kiss, roughly but not forcefully parting Arthur’s. It hit Arthur halfway through the kiss and he had started laughing at how annoyed Merlin actually was. For a second he thought about what he would have done if Arthur had pushed it further. Merlin would have probably bitten his lip not too softly. “Alright.” he mumbled, trying to stop his laughter before he stole one last peck and sat back, looking at Merlin who was somewhere between mad, amused, and turned on. “You earned it.” “Oh, how honourable of you.” Merlin mocked Arthur, regarding him with narrow eyes. “We’re going ice skating.” Arthur blurted out. The brief silence after Arthur’s words broke with Merlin’s laughter. His eyes had teared up and his face had gone red before he finally calmed down. “That was a good one.” “Now tell me, what did you find?” he asked, giggling at the end. “I told you we’re going ice skating.” Arthur repeated himself. “You— you’re serious?” Arthur didn’t understand why it was funny or ungraspable. “Why wouldn’t I be?” “No, no. No, we’re not doing that.” Merlin shook his head. “Wha—” “Getting a concussion from falling and hitting my head on an ice rink is not how I want to end our trip, thank you very much.” Merlin replied, his words coming out fast like they always did when he was mad or when things weren’t going according to what he wanted. “You won’t fall and you won’t get a concussion.” Arthur replied. Merlin shot him another look that signalled how done he was with this conversation. “I’ll hold you.” Arthur smiled. “And that’s supposed to be reassuring, how?” “Ouch, and there isn’t really much of a way out.” Arthur pursed his lips in thought. It had been one of their wishes to visit New York and see all the landmarks there. It was way different than how life was in England, and they wanted the change. They had agreed to discover new places and activities they hadn’t done before, and when Arthur spotted Rockefeller Center, it was like a bulb had lit over his head. They had been in New York for quite a few days, and how it had slipped their mind to go down to Rockefeller Center, Arthur didn’t know. “What do you mean?” Merlin asked, his tone careful. “I mean,” Arthur inhaled, preparing himself for an assault from Merlin when he heard his next words. “I already booked our tickets.” “You did what ?” Merlin yelped in shock before his eyes turned to blue slits. “Do you even know how to skate?” he asked, obviously knowing what Arthur’s answer was. “Low blow.” Arthur said, sounding betrayed. “A deserved one.” Merlin joked, and after a few seconds surrendered and made his way over to Arthur, resting beside him. Arthur draped an arm over his shoulder, bringing him closer to his side while Merlin rested his head in the crook of Arthur’s neck. “I’m going to kill you for this.” Merlin murmured, and Arthur could hear the drowsiness in his voice. “Oh, so this is what “love kills” means?” Arthur sarcastically asked. “Arthur.” “Hmm?” “Shut up.” “I love you too, darling.” He felt Merlin’s body vibrate shortly in a quiet laugh before it gradually relaxed in Arthur’s arms, indicating that he had fallen asleep. It was indeed dark outside, but Arthur had lost count of time. It happened frequently, and he liked to think that when he was with Merlin, time didn’t matter. The view from their bedroom window was quite nice. Nothing like London’s old and artistic buildings that he was used to. Here it was mostly broad buildings and skyscrapers. Not that London didn’t have either of those, but the essence was different. Here everything seemed to beat with life. Even from where he laid in bed, Arthur could see the illumination that the city lights casted across the sky. When he realised that he had started missing home, Arthur closed his eyes and dreamt of flowing river water, a bridge, and two lovers who seemed to see nothing else in the world but one another. The next day, Merlin and Arthur spent their time touring Rockefeller Center taking silly pictures of each other and making jokes about random strangers who passed by them. Merlin had loosened up, and actually started looking forward to going down to the ice rink, which left Arthur relieved. He had convinced Merlin that people would be everywhere around them, and not all of them would be ridiculously skilled at the activity. They had also bought so many things that they didn’t exactly “need”, but it was hard not to buy anything when you were going to a shopping centre. The weather was chilly today, and while the sun was up, it had kept them warmer than they were feeling now. They were nearing sunset, and more people (if it were possible) were starting to crowd the area. Families, couples, friends, people of all ages could be seen all around them. One of the shop owners was nice to Merlin and Arthur, and had told them that they had to come here on Christmas to see the enormous tree displayed there every year. Merlin had bought a blue fleece scarf to wear over his black sweater, and Arthur had settled on a gray warm up jacket. They had been advised not to wear too heavy clothes because they would be moving around too much, which made sense. As they tied the laces of the ice skates they rented, Arthur heard Merlin mumble something that sounded like “regret this”. When Arthur was done, he glanced at Merlin who was gazing at the hoard of people swinging left and right on the slippery surface barely a foot away from the two of them. “It’ll be fun.” Arthur tried to sound enthusiastic. “Watching you fall head first? Oh, that definitely will be.” Merlin fastened his blue scarf over his neck. It was a very dark blue that made his eyes look like the depth of the ocean. “Very funny.” Arthur rolled his eyes, though part of him had a feeling that this, indeed, might happen. He had a feeling that the second he would step out there, he was going to slip and possibly break his back. The ice rink was huge. White glistening surface that seemed to send its chill up into the air around the skaters, leaving their breaths coming out in small puffs of smoke. Children were speeding everywhere, girls with their hair flying behind them and boys with the wind blowing their hair out of their faces. The sound of merry laughter was everywhere around them, preceded by thumps of people who had fallen and were trying to get up. Merlin and Arthur had held hands, Arthur stepping first onto the ice. His foot nearly went out from under him, but he quickly regained his balance. It was a strange and funny feeling to have one foot on solid, rough ground and the other on an entirely slippery one. Merlin had half glared and half looked at him in panic, his hand going bone-crushing around Arthur’s but he only nodded in reassurance, chuckling to himself. Once he secured two feet on the rink, he urged Merlin after him. Merlin slipped too once his feet hit the ice but Arthur was quick to steady him. “Told you I’d hold you.” He smiled, purposely teasing Merlin. “Oh, piss off.” Merlin scoffed, but he was grinning. Arthur was aware that they looked like idiots clinging to each other at the very opening of the rink, barely moving. Merlin started laughing. “How on Earth are we going to move?” His face has started reddening from laughter, the way Arthur loved seeing him. The crinkles by his eyes when he heartily laughed looked kissable. “You know, we don’t really have to move. I quite like standing there with you pressed up against me.” Arthur snarkily said, his smile widening at Merlin’s reaction. He nudged Arthur’s chest with his hand, but quickly fisted his jacket and pulled him back to him when he realised that the slightest movement could send them both falling. “This is the worst idea ever.” Merlin shook his head, looking around them. “It’s definitely better than yoga.” Arthur replied, joining Merlin in checking out the people flying by them. “Oh god,” Merlin sighed after a few moments, looking down at them. “What?” Arthur asked, curious. “I’m starting to think the museum idea was actually good.” Both of them burst out laughing, “we eventually have to move.” Merlin said between giggles. “Alright, here’s the plan. I’ll let go, and you grab hold of the railing.” Arthur said, pointing at the barrier near them. “What about you?” Merlin asked. Arthur stayed silent for a moment. “I’m going to put the money we paid for this into effect.” Upon hearing how ridiculous he sounded, he mentally cringed. “The floor is yours.” Merlin said, as if he was, in all ways, ready to watch Arthur make a fool of himself. In one hasty movement, Merlin found his way to the railing and held onto it for dear life until his feet stopped slipping. Standing on his own, Arthur zipped his jacket all the way up, starting to feel the cold of the ground he was standing on. He really had to move. Arthur closed his eyes for a brief moment and prayed that the muscles of his body remembered anything from what he had learnt centuries ago while he was still a royal prince. It hadn’t felt like centuries to him; it felt like a few hours and he had woken up afterward in a whole new world. So, he trusted his body and slightly leant forward, curving his back. He put one foot in front of the other, and the other automatically followed, sending him one step forward. It sort of started to become a pattern, one slide dragged the other and before he knew it, he was spinning the rink, passing by groups of friends and parents skating hand in hand with their children. It was a pleasant feeling. If Arthur had to put it into words, it would be like flying without wings. The air whipped his blond hair back, baring his forehead. Arthur heard Merlin cheering from a distance, which drew a grin on his face as he swung himself with the circular shape of the rink and neared Merlin. When the distance grew smaller, Arthur shifted one foot to halt himself right in time before he collided with Merlin. He managed to completely stop himself by leaning onto the handrail and looking up at Merlin, who was regarding him with a not too cheeky smile. “It’s only now that I’ve realised where “not everyone will be ridiculously skilled at it” came from.” He narrowed his eyes at Arthur. “Well, yes, there are—” Arthur was in the middle of pointing to a group of friends who were huddled near the rail just like the two of them when Merlin interrupted him. “ You are ridiculously good at ice skating.” He pointed an accusing finger at him. “It’s not really as difficult as it seems.” Arthur shrugged. “Come on, stop complaining and give me your hand. I’ll help you.” He offered, but Merlin gave him a thoughtful look. Something was quick to flash in his eyes before it went away as quickly as it came. “I don’t need your humble hand of help.” His eyes shone in a bright shade of gold for a moment before it shimmered away and Arthur was left staring into Merlin’s mischievous eyes. “That’s cheating !” Arthur exclaimed, his voice rising in intonation. “Words of a royal prat who’s scared of a little competition.” Merlin remarked, a playful smile plastered on his lips. From where Arthur leant on the barrier behind him, he could see how Merlin looked under the sunset sky. It burned in bright orange shot through with pink and purple. The scene was beautiful; the clouds were light and swirled like floating pieces of cotton candy. The lilac-orange tint of sunset was reflected on Merlin’s features, bouncing off of his high cheekbones and making his hair look like a drop of black ink on a colourful canvas. He offered his hand for Arthur, whose blood was boiling with challenge, so he immediately took it. “I see history repeating itself.” Arthur carefully stood back up, purposely trying not to depend too much on Merlin’s hand in his. His smile matched Merlin’s. “Only this time I get to set the rules, sorcerer.” He tapped Merlin’s chin with his forefinger, earning a chuckle from him. “If that’s what will satisfy you.” Merlin shrugged with all the nonchalance in the world. “Go ahead.” He was so oblivious to what Arthur was going to say next that he was actually excited to see how Merlin would react to that . “Dance us around this ice rink.” Arthur said, his tone stripped of everything but challenge. Merlin’s face fell blank. “Seriously?” Arthur lifted his shoulders. “It’s only fair.” “There is no music around .” Merlin protested, causing Arthur to raise his eyebrows. “ That’s your problem? Really?” He was trying to stop himself from laughing. Merlin roughly pulled Arthur into him, raising their held hands next to them while an arm snaked around his waist. “You know I could easily turn you into a complete idiot in the middle of this rink without lifting a finger, don’t you?” He threatened as they started sliding their way further into the spacious land, careful to avoid the figures speeding everywhere around them. “Oh, I know you can.” Arthur said, his hand reaching up to rest on Merlin’s shoulder blade. “But you wouldn’t.” “I most certainly would.” Merlin disagreed, as he spun both of them in a short whirl, their skates sending thin flakes of ice around their feet. “You—” Arthur didn’t get to finish his words before he saw a flash of gold and he was suddenly sprawled out onto the cold, hard ice with a throbbing back. “ My back! ” he groaned, reaching for the injured area. He was sure he heard it crack at some point. Arthur could very clearly hear the familiar fit of laughter not too far away from him. “Alright, point made.” he reluctantly said. Merlin’s face had come into view over him, appearing in the sky. “Now, help me up.” He lifted his arm up for Merlin to take his hand. “So I could join you down there? No, thank you. You can get up on your own, big boy.” Merlin shook his head in refusal. “Merlin, don’t be silly.” Arthur rolled his eyes, sitting up. His hands stung where they were flat against the ice, and his legs were awkwardly extended in front of him, black jeans stained with faint powdery ice that was going to turn to water later. One hour really was enough in this rink. He looked like an idiot, just like Merlin had said, and they were, indeed, in the middle of the floor. No one was looking at them though. Everyone was busy enough enjoying their time to be looking at strangers. Before Merlin could reply, a figure skated up to them. A girl of about thirteen or fourteen. She was wearing a warm up jacket like Arthur’s, except hers was pink. Her brown-blonde hair was in two braids that dangled down her shoulders and she was shyly smiling at the two of them. She had fair skin and light hazel eyes that flickered between the chaotic lovers. “Hi.” she said, her fingers fumbling with the zipper of her jacket. “I saw you dancing earlier, before you fell—” she pointed at Arthur and started giggling before she recollected herself, torn between laughing again and looking embarrassed that she was laughing. Arthur shot Merlin a sideways glare, which he returned with a falsely innocent shrug. “But you looked lovely.” the little girl admitted. “Oh, thank you!” Merlin replied cheerfully, catching her attention. “What’s your name?” “My name’s Holly.” She beamed, her perfectly aligned teeth showing. “A beautiful name, like its bearer.” Arthur said, almost regretting it afterwards. The girl’s face went as red as a tomato, and her eyes grew wide. That was something Arthur had never seen before. She seemed to not at all believe that Arthur had just complimented her which was unfair. She really was beautiful. “Thank you.” she merely whispered, her smile somewhere between too shy and too happy. It was adorable, Arthur thought. “Is there something we can do for you?” Merlin asked her. “There’s a— uhm, could you— could you dance again?” Holly asked, pointing at Arthur and Merlin to get back to what they were doing. “See, there’s a— I have a school project.” She sighed, like explaining this was already a complicated task for her. “We’re supposed to write about any two people who love each other.” She grimaced when she was done talking as if she was questioning the whole thing in the first place. Merlin raised his eyebrows. “And you think we do?” “My mum does too.” She half turned to point at her mother who was standing a few miles away. Upon seeing her daughter pointing at her, the woman waved. “She told me to come ask you if I could use you as inspiration for my project.” She blushed again, which caused both Merlin and Arthur to smile. “Why, of course.” Merlin answered, kindly smiling at her. Holly’s eyes lit up, “thank you!” Arthur watched as she took out a small camera from her pocket and switched it on. When her eyes met Arthur’s, she raised the gadget in her hand, “do you mind?” Both Arthur and Merlin reassuringly shook their heads. “It’s our pleasure, Miss Holly.” Arthur grinned, seeing her smile widening and the colour in her cheeks brightening. “You’re highly enjoying yourself, aren’t you?” Merlin muttered to Arthur as he helped him up. “I’m about to be captured in one of New York’s most famous landmarks with my future husband by a girl who was asked to find two people who love each other to write about. I don’t see a reason as to why I shouldn’t enjoy myself.” Arthur smiled, his eyes looking directly into Merlin’s as the two of them went back to how they were moving before Arthur had fallen. Dancing on ice was tricky, but it left Arthur feeling a lightness that made him feel like he was floating over air with Merlin. It wasn’t like regular dancing at all. It involved a great deal of slides and spins and silly smiles filled with love. Arthur could hear the sound of the sutter going on and off every once in a while, but he didn’t dare look at Holly. He had caused the poor girl enough blushing. “Well, when you put it like that.” Merlin grinned, the kind of grin that made Arthur feel like he was the only person in the world that mattered to Merlin. Merlin moved easily, having enchanted his own feet, and Arthur wasn’t having much difficulty moving himself let alone with Merlin leading both of them now. They merged together like one symphony of ice and fire, and Arthur found himself lost in the way Merlin’s hands were gentle yet careful while they held Arthur. How they moved from his waist to his back when needed, how they both easily reached for each others’ hands when distance separated them. Their eyes were on each other, as if both of them were seeing one other for the first time. Merlin’s face was flushed, and his lips had gone pinker than ever. His blue scarf had loosened around his neck, revealing the hollow base of his throat and the edges of his collar bones. All spots where Arthur loved to plant feathery kisses at the end of a long day when they would be laying in bed together. As if the moment could get any more perfect, a song started playing through the public speakers. It was a soft slow melody that brought the couple closer to each other. “Looks like your problem is solved.” Arthur larkily said. Merlin leaned his head closer and rested it against the side of Arthur’s. “I actually love this song.” he mumbled. “Tell me about it.” Arthur closed his eyes and imagined Merlin sitting by himself on a rainy day with a cup of coffee in his hand and earphones jammed in his ears. “Just listen.” Merlin said, and there was something about the tone of his voice that shook something in Arthur. It was soft and pleading, as if he had finally had the chance to say this. “... and can you feel the love tonight? It is where we are It&#x27;s enough for this wide-eyed wanderer That we got this far.” They swayed to the music, an image of Merlin wandering this earth on his own forming in Arthur’s mind. He was reminded of the countless nights Merlin had to spend alone, every hour, every moment and how it must have been soul-crushing. “... and can you feel the love tonight How it’s laid to rest? It’s enough to make kings and vagabonds Believe the very best.” Then Arthur had risen, and everything else had toppled down from around Merlin’s heart. The solid walls of yearning, pain and time had been wrecked. Over time, of course, but the journey had been difficult. Even Arthur himself took time to adjust to this; to know himself here. Arthur heard Merlin’s soft, deep voice singing in his ears, loud enough only for him to hear as the next verse played. He had never heard him sing before, and Arthur had to admit that it was beautiful. His voice, how it fell in tune with the music that played, how every single thing around them seemed to sing and dance with them. The sky was darkening above them, and stars were starting to show. The figures that sped past them had seemed to fall into slow motion, and there was only Merlin and Arthur skating back and forth to the music, arms all around each other. “There’s a rhyme and reason To the wild outdoors…” Merlin placed Arthur’s hand over his erratically beating heart the moment they collided again, stopping all movement. “When the heart of this star-crossed voyager beats in time with yours.” When Arthur looked into Merlin’s eyes, he found them shining; a pair of deep blue orbs that threatened to overflow with tears, but Arthur had brought his lips to each one, kissing away the tears. He heard the shutter of the camera clicking again, reminding him of the presence of their admirer. “I didn’t know you sang this beautifully.” Arthur slid a finger down Merlin’s cheek, feeling the smooth skin under his touch. Merlin shyly smiled, “Neither did I.” He rubbed the back of his neck. “It just sort of happened. I really love that song.” “He seems to be singing about you.” Arthur lightly said, pointing out how the words perfectly fit them. “Us.” Merlin corrected, resting his forehead against Arthur’s. Arthur heard the camera click once. “It does talk about two lovers who lost each other when they were both very young, and years later, love found them again.” Merlin explained, and chills spread across Arthur’s covered skin. Flashes of war and blood and darkness, of a broken sorcerer and a dying king appeared behind Arthur’s eyes. He felt Merlin’s touch on the skin where his neck met his jaw. “We’re here now, and nothing in the world can change that.” He must have seen it in his eyes, because Merlin’s eyes were full of security and hope that brought the weight of their beautiful moment back. “I think we’ve made quite the show for our fan over there.” Merlin joked, stroking Arthur’s cheek, who laughed at his words at the same moment he heard the camera followed by a white flash of light. “Sounds like it.” he replied, turning to look at Holly whose face was hidden behind the camera. When she saw that they were looking at her, she lowered it down and skidded over to them. Both Arthur and Merlin held each of her hands to stop her as she reached them, stopping her from falling. She seemed to barely need their hand, but she smiled and politely thanked them anyway. “So, how did we do?” Arthur curiously asked, bringing one of her braids forward over her shoulder. “I think you will really like the photos.” She said, pressing a few buttons in the black gadget she was holding before she placed it in Merlin’s hands and showed him where to press if he wanted to go through them all. “You looked too in love in almost all of them.” “Is that a bad thing?” Arthur wondered, his expression humorous. “Not to me.” Holly shrugged. “Wait, there’s actually one I wanted to show you the most. I think it’s going to be one of the pictures I’ll attach with my paper.” She flipped through the dozens of photos displayed on the small screen until she reached the one she wanted. “What do you think?” she asked eagerly, placing her hands over her cheeks in anticipation. “Wow…” Arthur heard Merlin breathe next to him. Arthur looked at what he was looking at, and the same reaction overtook him. His lips parted in awe at how beautiful the photo was. Both of them were two arms length away from each other, flakes of snow were flying from their skates up around their legs. Their hands were extended towards each other, fingers barely touching, and their laughs were matching. Merlin’s eyes were almost closed, looking like one of the wrinkles around them. Arthur didn’t look that different as well. He looked happy. They both did. “It’s beautiful, Holly. Thank you.” Arthur genuinely thanked her, which drew a satisfied grin on her face. “There’s another one.” She added quickly, continuously pressing the ‘next’ button until she stopped at another photo. This one was towards the end of their dance. It looked like Arthur had just pulled away from Merlin, who was looking down at him as if Arthur was the lighthouse that had been long lost in storms and had finally blazed to life with light. They were standing in each other’s arms, and Holly had shot her photo at the perfect moment. There was no one else in it other than Arthur and Merlin. “Thank you for seeing us fit for your project.” Merlin handed back her camera, which Holly took and hung by the strap around her neck. “Is there any way in which we can keep them?” Holly nodded, “of course! Just give me your email address and I’ll send them to you.” She took out her phone and typed it after Merlin before she shoved it back into her pocket. “You never told me your names.” Holly frowned. “I’m Arthur.” Arthur smiled. “Merlin.” Merlin followed, waiting for it. Holly raised her eyebrows, looking at them as if they were idiots. “Like the legends?” “ Exactly like the legends.” Merlin replied, as if he had grown tired of repeating this, but still not unkindly. “What an odd coincidence, a favourable one though.” She looked like she was having trouble stifling her laugh again, so she cleared her throat and put out her hand for them to shake. “Anyway, it was nice meeting you, Merlin ,” she addressed him as she shook his hand. “ Arthur .” Her hazel eyes were beaming with joy and contentment as she nodded at them after she shook Arthur’s hand and skated away back to her mother. “Well, I certainly did not see that coming.” Merlin sighed, looking at Arthur. “Which part?” Arthur chuckled. “Pretty much all of it.” Merlin said after a few moments’ thinking. “Can we go now, though? My feet are killing me.” He threw his head back with his face scrunched up. “I think our time is already up.” Arthur answered. “Let’s go.” He took Merlin’s hand in his and they both sped back to the opening of the rink where they had first come in. They stepped down to normal ground and the two almost doubled over at the shift between the surfaces of flooring. They must have looked hilarious to the people around them, but again, one was paying attention. Something Arthur had grown to like about New York, was that no one bothered to take a second glance at you (that’s if they even took a first one). They rid themselves of their rented skates, put their regular shoes back on, took their belongings and left. “Never has wearing normal shoes felt better.” Merlin said at the same time Arthur was thinking about how much he was looking forward to lying in bed without the layers he was wearing. “It wasn’t that terrible though.” Arthur said as they rounded the corner, which, at its end, waited their hotel building. “No.” Merlin replied, a reminiscing smile shaping his lips. “No, it wasn’t. I actually had fun.” He slung an arm over Arthur’s shoulder. “Me too.” Arthur agreed, leaning his head on Merlin’s shoulder and holding the hand that hung loosely over his own left shoulder. The street wasn’t entirely empty, but it wasn’t crammed with passersby as well. The sky had gone completely dark now, dotted with winking stars. Colourful banners and billboards shone everywhere around them as Merlin and Arthur strolled back to where they had been staying. They shortly reached their destination and both were happier than ever to toss their shopping bags wherever they landed. Arthur wasted no time in taking off his trousers that had become damp from the ice, along with his shirt and jacket. By the time his head was out of his shirt, Arthur was already daydreaming of the hot shower water. Merlin was busy himself with taking his used clothes off, and when Arthur had glanced at him before he went into the bathroom, he was still occupied. Arthur stepped into the shower and turned on the water, letting it stream down his tense body and rejoicing in how good the warm water felt as it drummed against his taut muscles. He was startled when he heard the door open and shut after him and a second later, Merlin was facing him under the running water. The glass cabin wasn’t exactly spacious, but it fit them. It was almost funny, the fact that it usually fit one person yet it was still perfect for two. Arthur wiped the water out of his eyes and ran his hands through his hair, slicking it back so he could see clearly. “You weren’t planning on showering alone, were you? Because I’m not sorry to intrude.” Merlin’s voice had a dark playful edge to it that caused Arthur’s breathing to falter. The water splashed down on his broad shoulders, running in ripples down his bare, slightly pink chest. It glided down his smooth skin like splinters of crystal and he suddenly looked like one of the Greek sculptures Merlin had shown him before. His hair almost fell into his eyes, dropping water down his face. His lips were full and wet and parted— Arthur crashed his lips against them in a hungry kiss, giving in to the feeling of wanting to feel his mouth on his in a heated rhythm. Arthur let Merlin pin him back against the wall as their lips continued to move together in a way that electrified Arthur’s nerves like never before. His back collided with the steamy surface as Merlin cupped the sides of his face. They were pressed up against each other, steaming and writhing with pleasure. Arthur’s hands were feeling the hard muscles of Merlin’s chest and stomach, stopping at the areas he knew Merlin liked how it felt when Arthur touched them. He slowly ran his fingers down the middle of his chest, tracing the firm muscles of his stomach and he felt Merlin shudder, which encouraged Arthur to move further. His fingertips delicately outlined the curved lines of his hip bones which earned him a soft sound from Merlin. Arthur took that to his advantage and deepened the kiss, softly biting onto Merlin’s lower lip. Merlin pulled away for a moment, only for his lips to meet different parts of Arthur’s skin. The prominent line of his jaw where he left wet, open mouthed kisses down to his neck while whispering his name. The water continued to run down on them, hot and urgent like the two of them. But soon enough, the shower had run cold, and Arthur and Merlin had found themselves a heap of damp bodies and fast breaths in bed. Arthur was lying on his back, still trying to catch his breath, while Merlin did the same. Arthur had a faint smile over his face, the day replaying behind his closed eyelids. When he opened his eyes, he looked at Merlin who, Arthur guessed, had already been looking at him as he laid on his side. Merlin looked beautiful. There was no other way to describe it. Not just hot or handsome, but beautiful . There was a kind of beauty that glazed his features with its glow now that Arthur couldn’t quite describe. It was the same beauty that had shown when they danced together earlier. There was something intimate about it, and Arthur felt lucky to be the one able to see Merlin in that state. “Stop.” Merlin bumped his shoulder with Arthur’s, coyly smiling at him. Even though Merlin was confident enough in his body and every move he made, Arthur’s flirtatious nature still found its way under the skin of that confidence and evoked those reactions from Merlin. “What? So, now I’m not allowed to admire my fiancé?” Arthur innocently remarked, laughing with Merlin as he did. When their laughter died down, Arthur spoke. “Have you ever thought of us with different names?” he asked, amused at the memory of Holly’s reaction to the pairing. Merlin’s eyes looked around for a second before a devilish grin transformed his face into someone else’s. “Oh god, I know that look.” Arthur groaned, already dreading what Merlin was going to say. “Artie?” Merlin bit his lip, stopping his smile from spreading to the rest of his face but it was futile. “You’ve officially gone mad.” Arthur stated, staring blankly at him, although his grin was starting to look contagious to Arthur. “Come onnn,” Merlin whined. “ No .” Arthur’s tone was final. “Think about it,” he suddenly sat up, preparing himself to demonstrate something. “The adventures of Merls and Artie in the modern world.” He motioned with his hands as if what he had just said was being displayed on one of NYC’s billboards. “The legend of Merls the wizard and King Artie.” Merlin sputtered, his face bright. “Wizard?” Arthur raised his eyebrows. “No?” Arthur had been holding his breath, but he finally let his laugh break loose. Merlin looked like a mixture of funny and adorable at the same time as he sat in bed half naked with his hair disheveled, and arms that hung in the air as if he was holding a banner. “Your name isn’t as bad as mine though.” Arthur protested, sitting up as well. “Merls doesn’t sound as horrible as Artie .” he pronounced the name with so much contempt that it caused Merlin to laugh. Merlin pretended to look hurt. “Horrible? If you think about it how I do,” he quoted Arthur, a smile spreading across his features. “It’s cute.” He shrugged. “King Artie.” He tested the name out loud for what seemed like the hundredth time. “Yes,” he agreed to himself as if Arthur was invisible. “Has a ring to it.” Arthur stayed silent, watching Merlin trying to look very convinced of his own words before Arthur took him by the hand towards him and nudged his nose with his. “Whatever you say, Merls .” And they broke into a fit of giggles. Holly was right. Maybe they were too in love with one another, but that was what it was all about, wasn’t it? No matter how far fate had thrown them centuries away from each other, love managed to find them again. The stars would spell their names, the wind would whisper their tales, the fire would roar of their courage and the battles they fought. Their story was as old as the night, and they were determined to rewrite it with love and pride and everlasting magic.

Who do I have to ask?” Merlin kept looking down. “Oh, come on Merlin, I’m sure there is someone here in Camelot you want to dance with. Just ask a girl to the feast, be quick before they’re all taken.” Arthur said playfully. He walked away. Merlin thought about it the rest of the day. He knew who he wanted to dance with, Gwen. But why would Gwen go to the feast with him? ‘Forget it Merlin…’ He mumbled to himself. Notes A short Christmas fic about Merlin and Gwen being in love. Enjoy! See the end of the work for more notes It’s finally Christmas, Arthur and Morgana had prepared a big feast. Everyone was invited: the knights, Merlin, Gwen, Gaius, Hunith and all the servants. Gwen practiced a few Christmas songs to sing, and Merlin used his magic to make it snow inside the castle. “So, Merlin. Have you asked anyone to the feast already? You should have, it’s tonight.” Arthur winked. “No, I didn’t ask anyone…” Merlin blushed, looking down, hoping Arthur wouldn’t see. “Why didn’t you?” “I don’t know. Who do I have to ask?” Merlin kept looking down. “Oh, come on Merlin, I’m sure there is someone here in Camelot you want to dance with. Just ask a girl to the feast, be quick before they’re all taken.” Arthur said playfully. He walked away. Merlin thought about it the rest of the day, of course he had to do his chores before the feast. He knew who he wanted to dance with, Gwen. He smiled because of the thought. But why would Gwen go to the feast with him? ‘Forget it Merlin…’ He mumbled to himself. ~ “Merlin, Gaius is looking for you.” A knight came over to the stable to tell him that. ‘This can wait’ he thought, and immediately went to Gaius. “You needed me?” “Yes, Merlin, I need you to take some medicines and herbs to the lower town.” He said while packing it in a small bag. “Sure, but after that I really have to keep going with my chores.” “That is alright Merlin.” Merlin wanted to leave but Gaius called him back. “Have you asked someone to the feast?” “Did Arthur told you to ask me that?” Merlin sighed. “No! He didn’t. I just wanted to know, but I take this as a no?” Gaius raised an eyebrow, like only he can do. “Exactly. And it’s not going to happen.” Merlin shut the door. There was a note in his bag of the places where he had to be. ‘Oh no…’ he thought. He had to go to Gwen too. The closer he got, he heard Gwen singing. She was practicing for tonight. And she needed some special herbs to make tea, so her throat won’t hurt later. Merlin decided it was better to just leave it at the door and leave. He wouldn’t be able to look her in her eyes after thinking about her all day. Merlin searched for the herbs in his bag. But when he found it and wanted to leave it at the door, Gwen had already seen him. “Hi Merlin.” She smiled. “Ah!” He almost jumped. “Gwen! You- you scared me.” He blushed. “Oh Merlin,” Gwen giggled. “come in, will you?” “eh, yeah- no, I can’t. I must take these to the people. Bye Gwen!” Nervously he looked around and walked away. Leaving Gwen confused at her door. ~ “Morgana?” Gwen nocked on the door of her chambers. “Gwen? Come in dear!” Gwen walked in and sat down. “Hey, is something wrong?” Morgana walked op to Gwen to sit next to her, wrapping her arm around her. “I- I just hoped Merlin would ask me to the feast… But he didn’t, and I was just at my house to bring the herbs for my tea, and he acted so weird. He almost run away.” Gwen’s voice was sad and soft. “Oh, well maybe he will ask you later? The feast hasn’t begun yet.” Morgana tried to comfort Gwen. A long silence followed, till Morgana stood up. “I have something for you.” “For me?” Gwen asked surprised. “Yes, for you.” Morgana smiled. “But- but why?” “Because I can. Come on.” She took Gwen’s hand and walked her over to her closet. “Close your eyes. Morgana opened the closed, getting a dress out. She held it in front of her, so Gwen can see it properly. “You can open them now, this is for you, for tonight.” “Wow…” Gwen whispered, she teared up. “That’s beautiful!” She hugged Morgana, who laughed. “You’ll look so pretty in it.” Gwen thanked her a thousand times, they talked for hours and had some snacks together. Merlin was almost ready bringing all the medicines around in the lower town. He decided to stop by Gwen to apologize for earlier. “Gwen?” He knocked on the door, looked though the window. But no one was home, so he went back to the stables. ~ Gwen was now helping the other servants to decorate the castle. Merlin was working on his last chores and Morgana had finally found Arthur after searching for half an hour. “So? Any news?” He asked. “Merlin obviously didn’t ask Gwen yet. She came to me, telling me he was acting all awkward. So, what about Merlin?” “He told me this morning that he didn’t ask anyone. I told him he should, he was blushing through the conversation. I guess he thinks I didn’t see it, but I did.” He laughed. Arthur liked those moments with Morgana, just two gossiping siblings trying to get Merlin and Gwen together. “I also gave the dress to Gwen… I tried to cheer her up, but nothing seemed to work… I know it was supposed to be a surprise but, I didn’t know what else to do.” They talked for a while. Trying to come up with something. And they did… ~ It was time for the feast. First, they have dinner, after dinner there is time for dancing. Merlin was lost in his thoughts when Gwen had to sing, and Morgana and Arthur noticed. They all had a lovely dinner, and when everyone had enough, they went to the throne room to dance. “Everyone! Let’s play a game!” Arthur looked at Morgana, they smiled. This was part of their plan. “We will dance, the musicians will stop the music at a random moment. The pair who ends up under the mistletoe, will kiss. Of course, this can be a kiss on the cheek if you prefer…” “Merlin?” Morgana looked around, to see if he was there. “Yes?” He stepped towards her. “Can you maybe use your magic to make a Mistletoe? Let it float in the air, so it’s not on the same place the whole time.” “Sure…” Merlin sighed, this was not what he had in mind by ‘dancing’. Once everyone was ready, Merlin looked around to see if there was anyone left to dance with. ‘Mother’, he whispered to himself, but she was with Gaius. Then he saw Gwen, he blushed and wanted to walk away. But Morgana grabbed him, “you’re not leaving now.” She had a smirk on her face. Meanwhile, Arthur was with Gwen. “Gwen, you have to dance with Merlin. I know you want to, and I also know he wants to.” He smiled and pushed her gently towards Merlin. “Eh, okay. I guess we have to dance together?” Merlin was nervous. Partly because he loved Gwen with his whole heart, and partly because he knew his mother was watching him. “Obviously…” Gwen smiled, blushed and stepped closer to Merlin, who was secretly checking her out. “You look… Pretty.” He said almost whispering. Gwen just smiled. “Let’s dance!” Arthur yelled. He and Morgana we’re going to dance together. Just because they could watch Gwen and Merlin, and they were able to talk about them. Everyone started dancing as soon the music started. The first time it stopped, two knights stood under the mistletoe. Them and the other knights laughed, the knights didn’t take it seriously and kissed each other on the cheek. The music started again. The second time the music stopped, it were 2 servants. The two loved each other, everyone knew that. They kissed, and the music started again. The third time the music stopped, it was Arthur and Morgana. Arthur laughed, Morgana tried to scream “but we’re siblings!!!”, but Arthur was faster and placed a quick kiss on her cheek. Morgana did the same, because yes, she loved her brother. They always had fun, and were not only siblings, but also best friends. It went on for a few rounds, but the seventeenth time, Morgana and Arthur watched the couple under the mistletoe. The whole room hadn’t been this silent before. Gwen and Merlin looked up. Gwen smiled, she had wished for this. Merlin slowly looked down to Gwen. He waited a moment, tried to get rid of all his fears and thoughts, and kissed Gwen. He wanted to break the kiss quickly, but before he could, Gwen kissed him back. Her arms around his neck, pulling him closer. It was a long, soft, but deep kiss. Gwen was the one to break it. They looked at each other. “I love you.” Gwen said. Merlin just teared up a little. “Really...? You do?” Gwen laughed. “Yes, I do.” “I- I love you too.” Merlin said, he had never been this happy. They kissed again, everyone was clapping. Hunith was just very proud of her little boy, who wasn’t that little anymore. Morgana and Arthur were glad their ‘game’ worked as planned. And Merlin and Gwen? They danced the whole night, smiling, and when the music stopped, they kissed. Even though they didn’t stand under the mistletoe. End Notes I hope you liked reading it. :) Merry Christmas everyone!

Kilgarahh advises him, however, that Merlin will return when Albion&#x27;s need is greatest. Basically Merlin dies instead of Arthur. Sword and sword clashed. Arthur stood on the hill, enable of moving as he watched the scene unfold in front of him. Morgana and Merlin faced each other, one sword dark black, and one golden. Magic seemed to seep from the earth as Warlock and High Priestess fought. “Stop this madness Morgana!” Merlin cried as he skid to a halt. “Never!” she screamed and with a flash of gold eyes, she faced a hand at Arthur’s direction. “Astrice!” She yowled as a fireball flew in his king’s direction. With no time to react, Merlin sent Excalibur flying in Arthur’s direction hilt first. Turning, he screamed words of old religion and Arthur was able to move a fraction of a second before he grabbed Excalibur and cut the ball of energy down the middle. A sudden glimpse at Morgana made Arthur cry out his friends name in warning. “Merlin, behind you!” he exclaimed before he was an anchor again and had to watch as Merlin turned and jolted as Morgana pulled the blackened blade from his abdomen. Merlin fell to his knees and Morgana kicked his chest before he fell onto his back. Morgana raised her sword over his heart and Merlin glanced in Arthur’s direction to grab Excalibur’s hilt just in time to block Morgana’s attack. “I blame myself for what you have become Morgana, but, this has to end.” he told her. “Fool, I’m a high priestess, no mortal blade can kill me.” She hissed back. Merlin pierced her heart. “This is no mortal blade, like yours, it was forged in dragon’s breath.” Merlin said as she fell beside him. He staggered to his feet and peered down at her. “Goodbye Morgana.” he whispered as she sucked in a shaky breath and silence followed after. Clutching his side, Merlin glanced once more at Arthur, who was freed of his bonds and was rushing down the hill toward him. “Arthur…” he whispered before he tentatively took a step forward and felt his knees buckle as he was suddenly falling forward. Eyes rolling back, he felt soft grass meet him as he landed on his side. Feebly opening sapphire eyes, he peered at his outstretched palm that had a dimming blue orb, the same that saved Arthur. It disappeared along with his strength. He could feel himself and his magic dying. “Merlin!” he heard and suddenly felt comforting hands roll him toward the voice. Arthur gazed in shock at the state of his Merlin. He was very pale, those usually bright blue eyes were only a sliver of paleness, and he was limp in his arms. “Merlin, please no.” Arthur whispered. Merlin gazed up at him through slits. “Arthur, I’m…” he tried to say, but he was cut off by the steady trickle of blood down his chin. “Don’t speak, please.” Arthur whispered, shaking his head in denial of Merlin dying in his arms. “Your such an idiot. You shouldn’t have taken Morgana on alone.” Arthur said down at him. “Someone had to save your royal backside.” Merlin joked, but cut off in a hiss of pain. He could feel the dark magic steadily traveling toward his heart. Even though he was magic itself, a forged blade in dragon’s breath was his bane. It felt like a shattered piece of glass entering his heart as he struggled for breath. Vision dimming, he all he could make out was Arthur’s golden hair, stark against the morning light. Arthur noticed that Merlin was struggling and shook him slightly. “Merlin, stay with me.” he whispered. “Arthur, I’m sorry I didn’t tell you. I’m sorry…” Merlin whispered and started his vision dimmed once more. A drop of water on his cheek made him come back. Rivers running down his own cheeks, Arthur shook his head. “Merlin, I don’t care if you are a sorcerer, or if you have magic. All I know is that I know now that you have used it only for me. That is all that matters now. You are the bravest man that I have ever met. All those jokes about you being a coward, I didn’t mean any of them. I was wrong to think that way. I am glad to have a friend like you.” Arthur finished. “You’re a prat, and a royal one.” Merlin whispered and glanced behind Arthur at the rising sun. “It is a new day.” he said. Grimacing one again in pain, he felt death calling him. “Arthur, I need to tell you something…” he tried to say, but Arthur cut him off. “You’re not going to say goodbye.” Arthur demanded. “No, thank you, for being my friend. It has been a honor serving you Arthur. I am glad to be your servant, till the day I die. And I swore that I would protect you, or die at your side.” Merlin said. Arthur nodded over tears. “You uplift your promise. And I will make one myself. Know this, I will never forget your loyal ness, your compassion, and most of all, your unselfish heart.” Arthur said. Merlin nodded and slowly he lost focus. “No, Merlin!” Arthur cried, not ready to lose his lion heart yet. He shook him, and Merlin glanced once more at his king, placed a hand on Arthur’s cheek and wiped away a tear with his thumb before his head was limp in Arthur’s arms and his hand fell away with a thud on the soft grass. “Merlin!” Arthur screamed to the heavens. Cradling that limp head, their foreheads met, as if that one act would bring him back. The sudden beating of wings made Arthur glance up and double take in shock. Golden scales gleaming in the sun, the Great Dragon landed and looked upon the young warlock in pity. Arthur drew his sword and stood over Merlin’s limp form. “I mean no harm once and future king.” Killgarahh said. “You, I killed you.” Arthur growled. The dragon laughed. “It was Merlin’s doing, young king. Out of his clemency, I lived. But, atlas, I could not foresee this. The blacked blade that the witch made from the young hatchling was meant for you. And having saved you from it, Merlin changed your fate.” the dragon said. “Can’t you save him?” Arthur asked. “No, young king, I’m afraid there is nothing you can do. The gates of Avalon have already closed, and Emry’s rests now.” Killgarahh said. “I can’t lose him! He’s my friend!” Arthur screamed. “No young man, no matter how great, can know his destiny. Some lives have been foretold Arthur. Merlin is not just a warlock, he is magic itself. Take heart, for when Albion’s need is greatest, Merlin, will rise again. It has been a privilege, Once and Future king. The story that we have been a part of, will live long in the minds if men.” he said, and with that, flew off never to be seen again. Waves lapping at his feet, Arthur gazed out at the tower in the middle of isle. Glancing down at Excalibur, he rubbed the hilt and brought the blade up, examining the writing. Gaius’s words rang clear in his mind. “Take me up, cast me away.” Arthur then hurled the sword into the lake, and just before it hit the water, a feminine hand grasped the hilt and the blade disappeared into the murky depths. Stepping into the water, he glanced in the boat. Choking back tears, he placed a hand on Merlin’s plaid forehead. “Merlin…” he whispered before taking off his cloak and covering half of him with it. With that he pushed it out. Watching its accent, Arthur let out a loud sob before turning and disappearing into the wood. Hundreds of years past and still there was no sign of the great warlock Emry’s. Some say that he is just a legend, others think differently. For the man walking by the isle, he knows it is fact. Arthur tugged his coat tightly around him as a semi passed by. Dropping his head low, he sighed and glanced at the isle before continuing, only to turn back and race toward the bank at a sudden flash of light and a small boat, slowly making its way toward him.</span> <a href="#" class="summary-toggle">[ + ]</a></div><div class="stats"><div class="stat-item"><strong>Rating:</strong> General Audiences</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Archive Warning:</strong> Choose Not To Use Archive Warnings</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Category:</strong> Other</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Fandom:</strong> Merlin (TV)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Character:</strong> Merlin (Merlin), Arthur Pendragon (Merlin), Kilgharrah (Merlin), Morgana (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Additional Tags:</strong> Character Death, Hurt/Comfort</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Published:</strong> 2015-01-23</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Words:</strong> 1371</div></div></div><div class="work-entry"><h2 class="title"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://download.archiveofourown.org/downloads/28270473/Distance%20is%20Better.pdf?updated_at=1609284329" target="_blank">Distance is Better Anyway</a></h2><div class="summary"><span class="summary-short">“It seems that you still need to catch up on your Shakespeare.

Please, just let me heal it.” + Hurt/Comfort Hope y&#x27;all enjoy! See the end of the work for more notes “Stay still!” “I will when you stop poking me!” The medic gave out an exasperated huff. One Arthur has been on the receiving end plenty of times. That being said, the medic jerked his (still bleeding) arm and continued to dab it with the antiseptic. Arthur let out an involuntary whine, but stopped moving. “I’ll stop poking you when you stay still. Your stitches opened, and we need to fix that before you bleed out! Now, stop being such a clotpole and let me do my job.” “Clotpole?” Arthur felt a grin growing on his lips. “What in the world is that?” The medic gave him a sly smirk as he cleaned the wound. Arthur feels his chest clench. Finally. Ever since Arthur was pulled out of the fray into Merlin’s tent, he has been nothing but stone cold and distant. Arthur knows he gave Merlin a fright with how bad he had looked wheeled inside. After three days of slow recovery, Merlin has still been closed off. After three days of almost being on the brink of death, Arthur has not seen a single smile from Merlin (not even the fake “I’m fine, really” smile he gives sometimes). “It seems that you still need to catch up on your Shakespeare. What, did daddy dearest not force you to have them memorized like he did with all the other books of literature?” Arthur throws back a laugh, but later regrets it when he feels his ribs protest. Merlin mutters something about idiot prats and being too stubborn in taking better care of their wellbeing. “That was just with War and Peace and you know it.” “Yes, your father was a war snob, wasn’t he?” “Careful there, Merlin,” Arthur teases while Merlin only smiles back. He can hear his breath hitch. God, does Merlin not know how much he loves his smile? How much he loves him? “Ah, forgive me, Colonel Pendragon, it seems that generals can’t be war snobs. My mistake.” He pinched Arthur uninjured arm in jest. “Hey, careful there, doctor! I’m a wounded man.” He chuckled while Merlin rolled his eyes preparing the needle to stitch back his arm. “A big baby is more like it.” Arthur protested at that. “Oh hush up. You’re still hurt. Just...let me heal you, please.” And Arthur did. For a while, they just sat in silence as Merlin restitched Arthur’s arm. He didn’t even try to interrupt the medic and focused more on something better. Merlin’s face was pinched in concentration while he worked and his eyes were that brilliant blue like they always were. Their usual glow was dimmed just like the past three days, but not as much as before. Still, Arthur can’t help but feel guilty about being the reason why Merlin is so down. “It’s not your fault,” Merlin whispers to him. Finishing up the last bit, Merlin cuts the extra thread and sits down on Arthur’s cot. “It’s not. You can’t control what the opposing side will do, so never blame yourself for this.” He’s now holding Arthur’s hands up to his chest. His voice is barely a whisper when he speaks, but Arthur can feel the firmness in it. Again, he can feel his insides squeeze because of Merlin. His steadfast loyalty, his kind heart-- all of it feels so overwhelming sometimes, but they give Arthur the strength he didn’t know he lost. He slips one of his hands out of merlin’s and cups the medic’s chin, rubbing his thumb across his cheek. “You just can’t let me have anything, can you?” Merlin smiles softly and oh, does that do something to Arthur&#x27;s heart for the upteenth time. “Of course not,” he croaks out, “can’t let your head be getting any bigger.” They’re sitting so close that Arthur could just lean in and kiss him. He doesn’t. As much as he loves this man, Arthur doesn’t want to impose on him. Being the army’s head medic, Merlin has seen a lot of death from strangers and close friends alike, and Arthur has seen him cry for all of them, giving out his heart to each one so freely. For Arthur being one of them if he ever falls on the field, he just can’t bear the thought of it. Of Merlin having to cry for him when he couldn’t give him anything in return. No, he can’t do that to him. Best to keep it like this and save Merlin any more heartbreak. Distance is better anyway in the long run.

Notes See the end of the work for notes “Mhfph.” Merlin blinked his eyes open, trying to access his surroundings. The room was so bright and he felt something warm beside him, wait, bright? His bedroom was always dark in the morning during the winter months. Whose bedroom was he in? At that moment, all of the memories of last night came flooding back to him. He blushed at the thought of what the pair had done. Merlin started to drift back into a peaceful sleep, he rarely felt so loved and safe as he did in these quiet moments shared with his king. As his vision started to fade, he saw the doorknob start to turn. In an instant, he snapped his eyes open, wide awake. Scrambling to hide, he fell off the bed, out of the view of whoever was about to enter. That person happened to be Gauis. “Merlin!” he whispered, “Are you in here?” Merlin remained dead silent. Merlin hadn’t yet told Gauis about him and Arthur. He felt a hint of shame creep up in him.Gaius must be worried, not knowing where Merlin was all night. Gauis was like a father to him, how could he have kept this a secret for so long? But how would he react when he found out that his nephew, a manservant, who was born with magic was sleeping with the king of Camelot? So caught up in his own concerns, his mind barely registered Gauis swift exit, He was brought out of these unpleasant thoughts by a groan coming from the bed above him. A face peeked out over top him. Arthur&#x27;s blonde hair tickled Merlin&#x27;s nose. &quot;What the hell are you doing?” Arthur mumbled into his sheets. “Uh,” Merlin paused, Arthur&#x27;s morning voice making it hard for Merlin to really focus on anything. “Checking for wormwood?” Was the response he gave. Arthur just rolled his eyes and grunted, making a gesture for Merlin to get off the fool and lay back down with him. Merlin pushed himself off the ground and climbed back up next to Arthur, tangling their legs as he slung an arm over his king. Arthur adjusted himself as well, sliding an arm under his lover and using the other to pull him closer. “ ‘Y have training with the knights and a meeting after lunch.” Merlin recited, words barely distinguishable as he talked into Arthur’s collarbone. “I&#x27;m afraid I won&#x27;t be able to make it to the training today.” The brunette smiled against his his sun kissed skin, unable to prevent the satisfaction he felt from showing on his face. Arthur peered down at him, a look of content shown on his face as he studied the boy beside him, tilting his head down to kiss his forehead. “You don’t seem to be that bothered by that Merlin.” “Pratt.” “Idiot.” End Notes Hey, I would like to thank anyone who read this.

I’m not going to let you fly to another country regardless of whether I’m with you or not!” Notes For Saja and part of the BBC Merlin Father&#x27;s Mpreg Fest “Absolutely not,” Merlin said, looking at his husband as if he had two heads, “You’re eight months pregnant Arthur! I’m not going to let you fly to another country regardless of whether I’m with you or not!” Arthur huffed and leaned back on the couch, rubbing his large stomach. “It’s your fault I’m like this anyway,” he replied, “And it’s not like we could take a trip after the baby is born, at least not for awhile, and even then we won’t be able to do everything we would have otherwise.” Merlin sighed and sat down next to Arthur, wrapping his arms around him. Arthur shifted on the couch, leaning against Merlin’s chest and closing his eyes. Merlin held him close, pressing a soft kiss into Arthur’s golden hair. The pregnancy had not been an easy one. Merlin&#x27;s magic helped as much as it could in keeping the baby and Arthur healthy, but it worsened the side effects. Merlin always worried for him, though Arthur told him not to. Arthur was strong, yes, but Merlin loved him too much to let anything happen. The rest of the evening passed uneventfully, watching Toy Story again because Arthur wanted to, cuddling on the couch. Merlin helped Arthur up despite his protests that it really wasn&#x27;t necessary and helped him into bed. &quot;You know I love you more than anything,&quot; Merlin whispered into Arthur&#x27;s back, &quot;I won&#x27;t let anything happen to you.&quot; &quot;I love you too,&quot; Arthur replied, &quot;Get some sleep, idiot.&quot; Merlin laughed, &quot;Prat.&quot; Even after Arthur&#x27;s breathing evened out, Merlin lay awake. He knew that Arthur had started feeling trapped by the limitations of pregnancy, but it wasn&#x27;t safe to take him anywhere this far along. When Arthur had first gotten pregnant, he had been unsure about wanting to carry, but after a series of conversations with Merlin, Morgana, Gwen, and Dr. Gaius, he decided he could do it. For the most part he loved it, especially the extent to which he could get Merlin to do things for him. But Merlin could see that there was still that little bit of reluctance, the fear that something will go wrong, the fear it would change everything too much for them to handle. Merlin pulled Arthur closer to him and swore that he would do everything he could to take away the fear. ***** Where was he? Arthur sighed and began pacing, well, waddling around their living room. The past few days Merlin had seemed distracted and distant, and now he was late to their date night that he had suggested. Was there someone else? would he have to do this by himself? Arthur steadied himself against the end of the cough. No, that was ridiculous. This was Merlin, they love each other and it will stay that way. Before he could continue speculating the door flew open and there was Merlin. &quot;What are you wearing?&quot; Arthur exclaimed, staring at his husband, who appeared to be in a pilot&#x27;s uniform, but with a bouree on his head and a lei around his neck. &quot;Mr. Pendragon, welcome!&quot; Merlin said, beaming, &quot;Please come aboard, it&#x27;s time to depart!&quot; Merlin helped him out of their house, where they were greeted by a convertible that definitely did not belong to them. &quot;I rented it,&quot; Merlin explained as he opened the door for Arthur, &quot;And off we go!&quot; As they drove, Arthur studied Merlin, who kept glancing at Arthur, trying to gage his reaction. Finally, they came to a stop in front of the local football stadium where Arthur&#x27;s pick up team plays. Merlin jumped out of the car and rushed to help Arthur. The stadium seemed empty when they entered, but Merlin led him to a seat anyway. Arthur was about to ask what Merlin was doing when a voice brought his attention to the pitch. &quot;Welcome amigo to the amazing perro fight of Madrid!&quot; Gwaine cheered from down below, wearing tights and a ridiculous sparkling jacket, and holding a bright red cloth. &quot;Ehrm... He means toro, like a bull,&quot; Merlin explained, then yelled down at Gwaine, &quot;Stop trying to speak Spanish!&quot; Then the music started to swell, and another figure ran out onto the pitch. It was Percy, wearing all brown and a pair of horns. Gwaine would wave his red cloth, and Percy would run at it, just as if it was a real bull fight. However, Gwaine wasn&#x27;t quick enough, and Percy tackled him to the ground. Both Merlin and Arthur laughed as Percy held up the red cloth in victory. He then jumped over the barrier separating the field from the seats, and ran up to Arthur and Merlin. “Here you go,” Percy said, and with a flourish, gave Arthur a small Spanish flag. “And off we go!” Merlin exclaimed, and led Arthur out of the stadium and back to the car. As they drove again, Arthur turned to Merlin and asked, “What are we doing?” “Travelling,” was the reply, “I know you want to on a big trip, but that’s not advisable this far along, so I decided to bring the destinations to you!” Once again, they came to a stop, but this time it was in front of a park. Instead of a walk, Merlin led him to a carriage and with a nod, they began clopping down the path. Arthur kept an eye out for a clue as to what they were doing here, but none came until they came to a stop. In front of a piñata in the shape of the Eiffel Tower. “I couldn’t find just a statue,” Merlin said, “And you can’t do France without the Eiffel Tower. But don’t worry, we’re not going to break it.” Arthur laughed and walked over to the paper mache landmark, “It’s very realistic,” he commented. “Now wait right there,” Merlin replied, and pulled out a disposable camera, “Can’t visit without a picture to remember it by!” Arthur just laughed harder, and missed the flash that went off. Merlin grabbed his hand, and dragged him down the path a little farther, where they met Gwen. All around her there were papers taped to the trees, threatening to escape with the breeze. “Welcome to the Louvre!” Gwen said, spreading her hands to encompass the pictures around her, “Please, no flash photography, as it can harm the paintings. If you’ll follow me, I’d be happy to give you a tour.” Gwen and Arthur walked around to each of the individual “paintings” and she told him the history and style of both the picture and the work. Merlin stood off to the side and watched smiling as they got into a deep discussion about one of the paintings. He was so lucky to have a partner as amazing as Arthur, and friends like Gwen, who put so much time into helping him do this for Arthur. “Merlin?” Arthur asked, cupping his neck, “Are you alright? You spaced out a little there.” Merlin just beamed back and replied, “Yeah I’m great. Ready for the next stop?” Arthur smiled and waved his little French flag in response. Arm in arm, the two of them went back to the carriage. On the way back to the car, Arthur rested his head on Merlin’s shoulder, absentmindedly twirling the flag in his fingers. “How did you know which paintings I wanted to see?” he asked suddenly, looking up at Merlin, who smiled softly. “I remembered you mentioning some of them,” he replied, “But Gwen picked out the rest.” Arthur squeezed Merlin’s hand. “Thank you,” he said. “We’ll go to the actual museum, I promise,” Merlin replied firmly, “I know this just isn’t the same.” “It was wonderful,” Arthur reassured him. “It’s not over yet!” Merlin reminded him, and helped him into the car, “Two more stops!” They heard their next destination before they saw it. The strains of Opera could be heard from down the street, and the two men just laughed. “Lance?” Arthur asked, and Merlin nodded. “I promise it’s not an opera though,” Merlin reassured him, “After that incident at Barber of Seville I know better.” Arthur looked abomished. “The insistence on silence is very modern! Excuse me for being traditional!” “Getting Gwaine to sneak a cat on stage? That’s traditional?” Merlin replied, shaking his head. “It happened the first performance,” Arthur defended. “Because it was being sabotaged!” Merlin exclaimed, “You could have just said that opera wasn’t really your thing, it really would have been sufficient.” Arthur just huffed as Merlin parked the car on the side of the road. Lance stood nearby with a boombox at his feet. He beamed at the couple as they got out of the car and turned off the music. The three of them walked over to the playground nearby. Arthur looked at the two of them, incredulous. “I know I’m pregnant, but the baby is still inside. You know that, right?” Merlin rolled his eyes as Lance replied, “We’re going on an archeological dig.” ***** “I found an Aphrodite!” Arthur exclaimed happily, holding up the small statue as proof. “Awesome!” Merlin replied happily, “Put him over there, next to my Athena.” Arthur did carefully, and examined their handiwork. They had found five statues of gods, ten pottery pieces, and eight glasses. All they had left was to uncover the village. He examined the remainder of the sandbox, searching for a good spot to continue digging. “I think I found it!” Merlin exclaimed, and motioned for Arthur to come over. Together with their brightly colored plastic shovels, buckets, and sieves, they began to dig in the right-hand corner of the box. Sure enough, they had found the village, complete with little people in their homes. The two of them beamed at each other, proud of all the hard work they had done in the sandbox for the past hour. “Congratulations!” Lance said, smiling, “Arthur, you’ve earned this,” and he handed him a small Italian flag. Together, Merlin and Arthur made their way back to the car, holding hands and laughing. “I can’t believe you arranged us to play in a sandbox,” Arthur laughed, still holding Merlin’s hand as he drove them to their final destination. “I didn’t,” Merlin admitted, smiling slightly, “I just asked Lance to do something Italian. I was expecting food.” “I had a lot of fun,” Arthur replied, “Where to next?” Merlin glanced over quickly and said, “What makes you think I’ll tell you? We’re almost there.” He parked the car by the river and a figure jogged up to open Arthur’s door. “Aloha!” Elyan said, grinning. He was wearing a bright pink Hawaiian shirt with flowers decorating them. He completed the ensemble with cargo shorts, flip flops, and a bucket hat. “Welcome to the exclusive resort!” he welcomed, throwing a lei around Arthur’s neck. He led them towards the water, where he had set up two lounging beach chairs. After helping Arthur into his, Merlin took his own seat, grinning. Around the chairs there were a few inflatable palm trees, a few tiki candles, and in front of the river there were two poles that were supporting a beach scene in between them. Elyan went behind the image and came out with drinks to give to both Arthur and Merlin. Merlin was about to ask Elyan about alcohol, which Arthur couldn’t have while pregnant, but Elyan answered before he even had a chance to ask. “It’s pineapple juice,” he explained, “No alcohol, but it can help with… other things,” and he winked before pulling a remote out of his pocket and pressing a button. Beach music filled the air and they laughed into their juice. “It wouldn’t be Hawaii without dancing,” Elyan said smirking, “I present to you now our favorite luau dancer!” From behind the beach scene came Leon, wearing a grass skirt and a coconut bra, his hair pulled back in a small bun. Merlin and Arthur howled in laughter as Leon seemed to prep himself, back facing them and standing up straighter. He turned around with as much flair as possible, exclaiming “Luau!” as excited as possible. He swayed his hips and waved his arms to the beat of the music. Merlin looked over at Arthur, who was laughing so hard that he was crying. Their eyes met, and they reached out and took each other’s hands. Arthur mouthed “Thank you, I love you,” and Merlin just mouthed “I love you too.” Then they turned their attention back to the show.</span> <a href="#" class="summary-toggle">[ + ]</a></div><div class="stats"><div class="stat-item"><strong>Rating:</strong> General Audiences</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Archive Warning:</strong> No Archive Warnings Apply</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Category:</strong> M/M</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Fandom:</strong> Merlin (TV)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Relationship:</strong> Merlin/Arthur Pendragon, Merlin/Arthur Pendragon (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Character:</strong> Merlin (Merlin), Arthur Pendragon (Merlin), Gwaine (Merlin), Percival (Merlin), Gwen (Merlin), Lancelot (Merlin), Elyan (Merlin), Leon (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Additional Tags:</strong> Established Relationship, Alternate Universe - Modern Setting, Mpreg, pregnant!arthur, Fluff</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Published:</strong> 2015-06-20</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Words:</strong> 2078</div></div></div><div class="work-entry"><h2 class="title"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://download.archiveofourown.org/downloads/16190492/Halloween%20Party.pdf?updated_at=1538771640" target="_blank">Halloween Party</a></h2><div class="summary">No summary found</div><div class="stats"><div class="stat-item"><strong>Rating:</strong> General Audiences</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Archive Warning:</strong> No Archive Warnings Apply</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Category:</strong> F/M, M/M, Multi</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Fandom:</strong> Merlin (TV), BBC Merlin, Merlin BBC</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Relationship:</strong> Merlin/Arthur Pendragon (Merlin), Gwen/Arthur Pendragon (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Character:</strong> Uther Pendragon (Merlin), Merlin (Merlin), Arthur Pendragon (Merlin), Gwen (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Additional Tags:</strong> October Prompt Challenge, Gay, Halloween, Merlin - Freeform, Pining Arthur</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Collections:</strong> Merlin October Fic Fest 2018</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Published:</strong> 2018-10-05</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Words:</strong> 626</div></div></div><div class="work-entry"><h2 class="title"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://download.archiveofourown.org/downloads/25783390/Hello%20Goodbye.pdf?updated_at=1596889257" target="_blank">Hello, Goodbye</a></h2><div class="summary"><span class="summary-short">Following a post on Tumblr, I will write a story for every prompt in the list.

It&#x27;s my first attempt to publish something like this, but I adore these two idiots too much to not try it. Day 10: a hello/goodbye kiss that is given without thinking – where neither person thinks twice about it Notes See the end of the work for notes The future King of Camelot was definitely not blushing. Arthur Pendragon had always been proud of his stoicism; he was known for keeping a stiff upper lip. How could he feel like this right now? His palms were sweating, his legs felt as wobbly as if he had swam for too long in a lake. All this nonsense for a damned kiss. That should have been one of those moments in life where you blink and pretend nothing happened. A few hours before, Merlin entered his chambers talking about how beautiful the sky was on that particular morning. When Merlin opened the curtains, the bright light of the sun made Arthur groan; he just wanted to turn his head and sleep till the day was over. He knew he had duties, but he also craved rest. “Rise and shine, lazy daisy!” Merlin and his stupid phrases! Arthur couldn&#x27;t repress a smile at the words. His manservant was really the kind of idiot Arthur needed in his life. After he tied the curtains back to keep them opened, Merlin went to warm up water for Arthur&#x27;s bath while the prince sat on the edge of the bed, yawning. Arthur passed a hand through his ruffled hair, watching Merlin&#x27;s back; he was wearing the purple tunic that morning. Arthur secretly adored that colour on the boy, it brought out Merlin&#x27;s eyes best. When Merlin turned his head, Arthur realized that he was staring at his manservant. To hide his embarrassment, the only thing he thought to do was try to take off his shirt, pretending he was getting ready for his bath. His half-asleep state coupled with the fact that he was actually gazing adoringly at Merlin, however, did not help Arthur to perform a simple gesture like that. Arthur got tangled in his white shirt, arms up in the air, the strings of the tunic wrapped around his wrists. Half of his abdomen was visible, but every struggled movement Arthur tried to do only made things worse. From the other side of the room, Arthur heard a muffled chuckle. “If you are laughing at me Mer lin, I promise I&#x27;ll have you hanged!” Arthur grumbled. In a minute, Merlin was at Arthur&#x27;s side, freeing him easily from the tangle of clothes Arthur trapped himself into. “Hello! You are adorable, did you know that?” Merlin said before gently pressing his lips to Arthur&#x27;s. A heartbeat later, Merlin was running like a maniac from his chambers, leaving Arthur sitting on his bed, the bath long forgotten and the white tunic still held tight in his hands. ** The next day, Merlin was back to doing his usual routine. He had claimed he wasn&#x27;t feeling well the day before in an effort to avoid seeing Arthur. Even if Merlin continued to do his tasks like nothing changed, there was misery in his eyes. Arthur decided to follow his lead for the sake of their friendship. However, when Arthur left his chambers that evening, something changed. His father, King Uther had asked his son to hunt and kill a beast that had been seen very close to Camelot&#x27;s forests. It had already killed dozens of knights, the few left were needed to protect the castle. “You can&#x27;t go there alone,” Merlin murmured while he stuck the wood in the fireplace. “So you are able to speak, I thought for a moment you lost your tongue,” Arthur replied, rolling his eyes. He paced in front of the windows, a pensive hand under his chin. “Stop it, Arthur,” Merlin said, turning towards Arthur. His manservant eyes seemed a little cloudy, but his expression was determined and fierce. “My duty is to protect you. I&#x27;ll come with you,” he proclaimed decisively. “No,” Arthur replied, walking towards him. “You can&#x27;t come with me, it&#x27;s too dangerous” “But...” “No, Merlin, don&#x27;t even think about that! I&#x27;ve already lost a lot of my men; do you think I could bear to lose you too?” Arthur asked in a tremulous voice. “I didn&#x27;t know you cared,” Merlin whispered, looking at his own feet; his face pale in the dim light of the fire. “You didn&#x27;t...?” Arthur began to ask, coming within arm’s reach of Merlin. “Listen to me. We have a lot to talk about, I know that. Please don&#x27;t pretend nothing happened just because of who I am. Merlin, look at me,” Arthur commanded while lifting Merlin&#x27;s chin with his right hand. When their eyes locked, Arthur couldn&#x27;t resist anymore. He pressed a gentle kiss to Merlin&#x27;s lips. The sound of a sharp intake of breath was the only answer Merlin could give, unable to draw away from the blissful kiss. When they parted for air, Merlin licked his lips, the taste of his prince still vivid and tempting. “This is not a goodbye,” Arthur told him, looking at his lips with hunger. “It’s a promise”. Arthur left his chambers determined to come back as soon as possible. He and Merlin had lots of things to speak about and lots of things to do.

Unfortunately, Merlin won&#x27;t leave it alone. Or: 4 times Merlin messes with Arthur&#x27;s hair, and 1 time Arthur got his own back. Part of a series, but each is a stand alone fic! Notes Part of my Camelot in Quarantine series - all (two so far) stand alone fics! Here&#x27;s another one because I love this Scruffy fest I tried for 5+1, but there&#x27;s only so much you can do to someone&#x27;s hair without them actually killing you Arthur hated the boredom stuck inside, although with Merlin around there was usually a mess to clean up somewhere. The boredom was certainly irritating, though. Yet, it was only third on the list of things he hated about the current lockdown. The second, very close to the first, was his hair. 1. “ Merlin!” He screamed from the bathroom, staring at his hair in the mirror. It had been a scruffy mess for awhile now, and Arthur had no trust in Merlin to try and cut it for him. He had seen the disaster cuts of friends with less patience than him, and he was even surprised to find that Morgana’s attempt at Gwen’s hair was a resounding failure. His own partner did not rush up the stairs, but Arthur heard him padding up with a laughter in every breath, knowing exactly what he had been shouted for. Arthur growled under his own breath, clenching his jaw, attempting to clamp down the anger. His reflection stared mockingly back at him, though, and the anger stayed at its peak, waiting patiently for the perpetrator of this evil crime to enter. “Yes, Arthur?” The man in question asked sweetly, doing terribly to hold back his full force of laughter as his hands hid behind his back innocently. “ You ,” Arthur pointed an aggressive finger at him, “don’t you have anything better to do?” “I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Merlin gasped, holding a hand to his heart. “Have you changed something, by the way?” He frowned. Arthur’s fists clenched by his side at the impossibility of this man, “how did you even do all of this?” Merlin shrugged, dropping his innocent act in an instant with a laugh, “I was honestly surprised you hadn’t woken up by the third one.” Arthur’s eyes widened, “there are more ?” His ridiculous, childish partner cracked then, holding an arm around his stomach as his eyes closed in a roar of laughter. Arthur stared at him, his anger only growing, something he wasn’t sure was possible. “At the back,” Merlin managed to gasp out, calming down, wiping away a tear in exaggeration. Arthur’s hand immediately flung to the back of his scalp, and sure enough, he felt more, even smaller braids there, too. If he wasn’t so angry, he might admire his partner’s determination to wrangle even the shortest pieces of his messy hair into a braid. Ears steaming, he let out a huff, looking desperately at the mirror. “Whatever,” he shook his head, “I need to get these out, now , I’ve got a call with my father in a few minutes.” “Your hair will be nice and wavy,” Merlin’s eyes lit up; Arthur’s glare grew darker. “Your lucky I don’t have time to murder you,” he grit out, “now come and help me!” 2. Arthur thought the braiding was bad, but apparently, that was where Merlin’s fun was only just beginning. Waking with an unmanly yelp which he would later vehemently deny, Arthur shot up from his napping spot on the sofa and searched round the room before his eyes fell on the giggling man- child. His eyes then caught what his partner was holding on to, and his fingers flittered up to hover over his chin, burning now where the shot of pain had come from. The emptiness left helped Arthur realise what had happened, and he fumed. “Merlin,” he spoke with a calmness he didn’t know he had in him, and he wasn’t sure how long it would last. “What have you done?” The idiot coughed out some more laughter, but tried to appear annoyed, “what? You said your beard was annoying you!” Arthur frowned, pulling his face in in confusion, “what are you talking about?” He waved his arms out, “I don’t recall asking you to wax it off !” “Well, I know but,” Merlin shrugged, “I read between the lines.” He tilted his head as he touched his nose, as if he had just given Arthur some kind of service. “I think my father was right,” Arthur blinked for a long time, “you might just be mental.” “Maybe,” Merlin scrunched his mouth to the side, and Arthur honestly had no reply. “If it helps, I haven’t waxed it all off.” “What?” Again, Arthur found his hands hovering over his chin, and found the man now sitting on the floor against the sofa staring up at him with amusement was right, “what?!” “You woke up before I could do the rest!” “Oh, I’m sorry ,” Arthur shouted through gritted teeth, “I hadn’t realised I’d interrupted you!” “Don’t worry about it,” Merlin grinned. Arthur smacked him across the head. “No need for that!” His partner rubbed at the side of his head, tutting. Arthur threw himself back against the sofa, burying his head in his hands with a strange sound of despair leaving his throat, “I hate you,” he bemoaned. He felt the sofa dip as Merlin perched himself beside him, but he refused to look at him. “Now you’re up, we can do the rest of it.” Arthur dropped his hands, rolling his eyes over to him. “I was going to shave it later,” he growled. “Oh,” Merlin’s mouthed. “I guess I’ve saved you the trouble,” he tried, pushing his neck into his shoulders. “I didn’t even know we had beard wax?” “We didn’t, I bought some specially.” “Thank you for that,” Arthur shook his head. “Anyway, this is for the best really, I keep getting stubble burn when we kiss.” “Oh, you needn’t worry about that,” Arthur pushed himself off the sofa to go and inspect the damage properly in a mirror, “there’s no chance I’ll ever kiss you again!” 3. “Your hair’s very scruffy, you know.” Merlin spoke in the quiet, stroking Arthur’s mess of hair as the blonde read a book. Apparently this had become his partner’s main point of entertainment for the day, then. “Very observant of you,” Arthur droned, not taking his eyes from the page. “Why won’t you let me cut it, again?” “You know why,” he answered with ease, having had this conversation with the man too many times. “Ah right,” Merlin nodded, “you think I’ll do a bad job.” Arthur plopped his book down, frowning, “no. I know you’ll do a bad job.” Merlin looked offended, “you don’t know my skills.” “What, all one of them? I think I do. The skill of causing me misery, that’s it, right?” “You’re exaggerating,” Arthur chuckled humourlessly, “oh, I don’t think I am.” “Still, I could do a nice job.” Arthur picked his book back up, “not happening.” There was a lull in conversation, then, and Arthur hoped he might just get to read in peace for once. “I could always do something else,” Merlin continued, though. “Hm… I think we have some straighteners in a draw somewhere.” Arthur’s brow furrowed, “why?” He felt Merlin shrug, “I think Morgana left them here when she came for the weekend. I told her they were here, but it wasn’t long before everything, so she’s not had chance to get them.” “I was more thinking, why are you talking about straighteners?” “I could straighten your hair.” It was the way he said it so casually, like it was just a normal thought, that worried Arthur the most. “Why do you hate me?” He groaned. “It might look nice!” “It already looks fine.” “Trust me,” Merlin winked down at him and then raised his eyebrows a second, “I know.” Shrugging, he continued, “but it’d be fun, to see how long it is when it’s straight.” “You could always look up fun in the dictionary.” Arthur suggested, but Merlin’s damn goofy smile widened at the idea formed fully in his head, and Arthur knew he was not getting out of this. He rolled his eyes, “if I let you, can I read my book at the same time?” Merlin’s smile widened, eyes lighting up, “can’t see why not.” Arthur considered himself mad, but sighed, “fine.” “You’re not supposed to tug!” He shouted, book long forgotten as Merlin attacked his hair with hot panels. “I’ve never done it before, have I?” Merlin argued back, frustrated by the task. “Maybe if you sat still!” “I’m sitting perfectly still, you’re just bad at it!” “You can do it yourself next time.” “I didn’t want it done in the first place!” Arthur threw his hands up, but it turned out to be a mistake, as Merlin tugged again at another part of his hair as he was thrown off balance. “Why did you agree, then?” And Arthur gawped like a fish, then, when no words stumbled out because how do you argue with an idiot? “I’m much better at cutting,” Merlin muttered to himself. There was no way in hell Arthur was letting Merlin near a pair of scissors. 4. At least Merlin was enjoying himself during this period, because now, as he watched his partner laugh mercilessly at him once again, he vowed Merlin would not make it out alive. Standing in the living room opposite one another, Arthur dripping from head to toe, covered only by a towel below his torso, he stared at the man with a hatred that had never been purer. “My hair,” he growled, throwing his hand up to point at it, although it was quite obvious. “Is blue ,” there was a deep sadness in his voice, but he tried to focus on his ire. “Suits you,” Merlin nodded in approval. “I could never pull it off.” Arthur wanted to cry. “The only thing you’d suit right now is a coffin .” Merlin gasped, “it’s not permanent or anything.” “I don’t care,” Arthur shook his head, “I have a meeting in twenty minutes! I doubt it’s that temporary, is it?” His partner at least looked sheepish. For all of five seconds. “I’m glad you find it so funny.” “Sorry, sorry,” Merlin said, coming back up for air. “No, it’s very serious. Very bad.” He cleared his throat, frowning mock seriously. Arthur wanted to say more, wanted to scream from the rooftop, wanted to cry into a pillow lamenting over his now dark blue hair. But he couldn’t, because he still had the meeting. “I am going to get dressed,” he exhaled, “and you are going to find me a hat.” Merlin didn’t move. “Now, I don’t want anything stupid. I want a normal hat,” Arthur spelt out emphatically, “can you do that?” “Yes, Sire,” Merlin bowed, but rushed away before Arthur could whack him. Hand clenching on his hold of the towel, he watched the man go with a fierce ire in his stare. Merlin, fortunately, had followed his instructions and given him a normal hat. Still, he stared at his own screen on the call, conscious that his hair might show. “Arthur, is everything alright?” Leon asked, catching Arthur’s eyes wandering off again. Coming back to the meeting, he shook his head, “fine, everything’s fine.” Leon’s eyes squinted, but after a moment he continued. “Princess,” Gwaine chirped in after a few minutes had passed, “I know you’ve got those pretty boy looks, but you don’t have to gaze at yourself all the time.” “I think he’s questioning the hat,” Elyan spoke then, and Leon rolled his eyes. “Alright, don’t worry, we can discuss the work later,” he mumbled. “Let’s stay on it,” Arthur said, hoping to deter them. “Now I definitely want to know what’s up,” Gwaine rubbed his hands together. “You do keep zoning out,” Leon shrugged. “What’s going on?” “His hair’s blue!” Arthur’s eyes widened as he turned so quickly his chair almost fell backwards. Merlin was behind him though to stop it falling, a twinkle in his eye as he grinned. “Go away,” Arthur whispered angrily. “What do you mean, his hair’s blue?” Gwaine asked, and Merlin bent down, a hovering head over Arthur’s shoulder. “He was experimenting,” Arthur wanted to throttle him. “I don’t think he’ll keep it like that, though.” “This I have to see!” “It’s not blue!” Arthur denied. “Prove it,” Gwaine dared, “take off the cap.” “He’s a bit shy about it,” Merlin whispered loudly. “Take off the cap!” Elyan repeated Gwaine’s words, and Arthur soon found all of his friends – only colleagues now – chanting together. Even Leon, the worst traitor of all. +1. The number one thing that Arthur hated in lockdown, top of the list, was probably his idiot partner who was delightfully clumsy, but damn masterful at manipulation, sometimes, when he wanted to be. “Arthur,” Merlin spoke calmly as he entered the living room, Arthur staring up at him with innocent eyes. “What is it, love?” Merlin crossed his arms, “I was just drying my hair,” he explained, “and then, well, you can see.” He waved his arm to his face, a dusty snow white. Arthur’s nose crinkled in a frown as he held back a laugh, “how’d you do that? I didn’t know flour was involved in your hair care regime.” Merlin blinked, “it isn’t .” Silence fell as they each waited for the other to break, Arthur’s eyes dancing with humour, but eager to hold off until the anger came. Merlin’s lips turned into a thin line as his shoulders slumped, “I see.” He strolled over, dropping himself beside Arthur with such weight that some of the powder jumped off his skin. Arthur could no longer hold back. “Yeah,” Merlin nodded with acceptance, “just get it all out.” And Arthur did, laughing for a good few minutes. “It’s about time,” he finally huffed. Merlin crossed his arms, “it’s only one time, I’ve got you so many times.” “But not this time,” “I suppose,” he shrugged, “but it’s not that impressive. I think my efforts had a lot more originality,” Merlin stuck his nose up. Arthur scoffed, “I don’t care, you look ridiculous!” “I think some of it went up my nose.” And so came the second round of belly laughter. “Let’s call truce?” Merlin asked when Arthur finally brought himself back up, eyes staring into the other man’s pleadingly. “No way,” Arthur stared back grinning, “I still have to get you back for the other times!” “Well, what if I made it up to you?” Merlin whispered, leaning in. Arthur’s attention caught, then, eyes dropping to his partner’s lips as they moved in closer. Merlin’s hand dropped on to Arthur’s sat between them, and Arthur couldn’t help but push himself forward. “How?” He asked softly. “I’m sure we can think of something,” Merlin smiled that smile that only Arthur saw, and he mirrored it. Merlin’s hand moved then and grabbed at his shirt collar, and Arthur found his lips pressed against his partner’s own in one swift movement. Sinking into it, his hand came to cradle Merlin’s chin, the other wrapping around his neck as they melded closer. The distraction lasted as he melted into the warm kiss, but his brain soon caught up as the dusting tickled his cheeks. His eyes opened wide before he pushed away in realisation, a grin already lighting up Merlin’s face before confusion had fully settled. “You tricked me!” Arthur pouted, “I’ve got flour all over me!” Merlin didn’t reply, but dabbed his own face where flour still lay settled, before smudging it on Arthur’s own in an audacious move. Arthur glared, “I’ll get you for that.” He growled lowly. “You’ll have to catch me first!” Merlin shouted, shooting up as he took advantage of Arthur’s sudden confusion. Arthur, having excellent reflexes that Merlin must have forgotten about, grabbed at the towel covering Merlin. Unfortunately, or fortunately, however one chose to look at it, Merlin’s own reflexes were not as good; the hand holding the towel lost its grip easily, and he tripped over as it was pulled from him. A grin spread over Arthur’s face, at the delight of the prank, as well as at the view now before him. “If you give up now,” he leaned down, grazing his lips against his partner’s ear as he whispered, “we can finish where we left off.” There were some small pleasures to life in lockdown, Arthur supposed.</span> <a href="#" class="summary-toggle">[ + ]</a></div><div class="stats"><div class="stat-item"><strong>Rating:</strong> General Audiences</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Archive Warning:</strong> No Archive Warnings Apply</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Category:</strong> M/M</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Fandom:</strong> Merlin (TV)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Relationship:</strong> Merlin/Arthur Pendragon (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Character:</strong> Merlin (Merlin), Arthur Pendragon (Merlin), Gwaine (Merlin), Leon (Merlin), Elyan (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Additional Tags:</strong> Fluff, Domestic Fluff, Merlin is a Little Shit, Scruffy Pendragon Fest (Merlin), 5+1 Things, except it&#x27;s 4+1, Alternate Universe - Modern Setting, Merlin is a Little Shit (Merlin), Kissing, Implied Sexual Content, Humor</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Collections:</strong> Scruffy Pendragon Fest</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Published:</strong> 2020-05-23</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Words:</strong> 2679</div></div></div><div class="work-entry"><h2 class="title"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://download.archiveofourown.org/downloads/13084236/Home%20for%20Christmas.pdf?updated_at=1513830841" target="_blank">Home for Christmas</a></h2><div class="summary"><span class="summary-short">Arthur wants Merlin to have a nice Christmas in Ealdor + Merlin doesn&#x27;t want to leave Arthur alone in Camelot for Christmas = a sweet, fluffy fic in which neither Arthur nor Merlin will be alone for Christmas.

No profit is being made, and no copyright infringement is intended. As he waited for Merlin, Arthur stood atop the roof and looked down over the snow-covered grounds, breathing in the crisp, cold air as he caught a whiff of something delicious—probably baked with love by the sweet little old lady, Miss Morgan, who sold her baked goods during the days leading up to Christmas. The thought brought a smile to Arthur’s face. Christmas hadn’t ever been a joyous occasion for him, at least not in the castle. In the village, yes, there were families who celebrated—a few had even invited Arthur and his sister into their homes on the festive day—but Uther Pendragon had no room in his heart for Christmas. Gaius had told him and Merlin that when Ygraine died, so had Uther, at least on the inside. The thought made Arthur sad. It was his fault his mother had died. Gaius repeatedly told him that wasn’t the truth, but it was. Had Arthur not been born, his mother would be alive this very day, preparing to celebrate Christmas with her husband. No amount of good-will from others could change the truth of that fact. The door opened, interrupting Arthur’s morose thoughts, but he was thankful for the distraction, and he felt good that at least someone would be having a happy Christmas. He turned around and attempted to smile. “Gaius said you needed to see me,” Merlin said softly as he came to stand beside Arthur, his eyes searching his master’s, probably trying to figure him out. Arthur had tried to make that endeavour impossible, but the more time he spent with Merlin, the more he wanted his servant to fathom him out. “Yes, I wanted to tell you that you are free to go see your mother for Christmas if you would like.” Arthur watched as Merlin’s eyes opened wide. The giant smile that followed warmed Arthur’s heart. “It has already been arranged. George will attend me whilst you are away. You may leave at first light.” Merlin seemed to be struggling with his response, which Arthur didn’t quite understand. Of course, he really did. The boy was far too loyal and probably had it in his mind that he didn’t want to leave his Master alone; he knew that Arthur’s father didn&#x27;t celebrate Christmas, after all. “Why don’t you come with me?” Merlin blurted out, looking somewhat taken aback at his bold statement, but after taking a breath, he nodded. “Yeah, my mum would be happy to have you.” Arthur let out a nervous laugh. There was no way he could take his leave and join Merlin. It was unthinkable. But was it? The knights had the next few days off to celebrate with their families. Arthur had no reason to remain in Camelot, and it wasn’t as if his father had plans for them. It was more than likely that he would get on his horse early Christmas morning and ride off into the woods for the day. He had done that for as long as Arthur could remember. Morgana said their father used that time to commune with nature and that it probably made him feel closer to his wife. Arthur wasn’t sure about that as it sounded a bit too sappy for the likes of his father, but Gwen assured him that even his father had it in him to be a romantic at heart. Arthur very nearly said yes as he looked into Merlin’s eyes, but he needed to check with his sister first, to be sure it was okay with her. “I need to check with Morgana. I don’t want to leave her alone.” Arthur felt very unsure of himself, but he found that he wanted to go with Merlin. “Okay, yeah. You can bring her if you want, and Gwen, too.” Merlin gave Arthur his patent grin that completely brightened the world around him. Arthur did allow a hearty laugh this time. “What will your mother say when you bring three guests with you?” “She will invite all of you into our house and ask you to remove your shoes,” was Merlin’s matter- of-fact response, his rosy cheeks looking adorable. “Yes, she would, wouldn’t she?” Arthur whispered, and when he heard the door to the roof opening he turned around and was surprised to see Morgana and Gwen. “Just the people I wanted to see,” he said before he asked them if they wanted to go to Ealdor for Christmas. “Yeah, it would make my mum happy for the three of you to join us.” Merlin looked like a little kid who was about to be handed a cookie. Arthur grinned. He loved that innocent, happy look on Merlin. “Thanks for asking, but Gwen and I planned a quiet day. Those are few and far between, at least without Father to contend with. I hope you understand.” Morgana looked between Arthur and Merlin, seemingly worried. Arthur shared a knowing grin with Merlin. “It looks like it’s just going to be you and me, Merlin.” Yes, Arthur should probably be a bit more sad that his sister and Gwen weren’t going to join them in Ealdor, but as he would have Merlin to himself he couldn’t be bothered to feel the least bit remorseful. Two days later Arthur and Merlin arrived at the small house, grey-ish smoke billowing out of the chimney, and watched as Merlin’s mother ran out to greet them, her smile so wide that her eyes disappeared. Arthur looked over at Merlin and felt a deep surge of warmth. “You boys are a sight for sore eyes, I tell you. Now get inside and take off your shoes so you can warm up by the fire.” Hunith put her hands around both boys and led them inside. Arthur’s heart was full. No, this wasn&#x27;t the Christmas he would have had had his mother lived, but he was with Merlin, and even though they hadn’t known each other long, Arthur felt like he was home for Christmas.</span> <a href="#" class="summary-toggle">[ + ]</a></div><div class="stats"><div class="stat-item"><strong>Rating:</strong> Teen And Up Audiences</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Archive Warning:</strong> No Archive Warnings Apply</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Category:</strong> M/M</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Fandom:</strong> Merlin (TV)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Relationship:</strong> Merlin/Arthur Pendragon (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Character:</strong> Merlin (Merlin), Arthur Pendragon (Merlin), Hunith (Merlin), Morgana (Merlin), Gwen (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Additional Tags:</strong> Short &amp; Sweet, Fluffy Ending, Past Character Death, Angst with a Happy Ending, Christmas Fluff, sad Arthur, Sweet Merlin, Caring Merlin, Canon Era, Missing Scene</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Collections:</strong> Camelot Drabble — Prompt #293: I&#x27;ll be home for Christmas</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Published:</strong> 2017-12-21</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Words:</strong> 1000</div></div></div><div class="work-entry"><h2 class="title"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://download.archiveofourown.org/downloads/36570382/Hug%20It%20Better.pdf?updated_at=1647960379" target="_blank">Hug It Better</a></h2><div class="summary"><span class="summary-short">Arthur has no clue why his servant turns up so blue and depressed sometimes, but he takes it upon himself to comfort him.

Or Four times Merlin shows up all sad and all &quot;Un-Merlin-like&quot;, and Arthur has no clue what happened and the one time he did. Notes I rewatched Merlin (again), and this came out. &#x27;You don&#x27;t have the liberty to make friends.&#x27;- had been one of the first things that Uther had taught Arthur. Arthur remembered the day Uther had given him this lesson- it had been one of those warm summer days that made you want to sink your feet in the grass and just run wild. He had been playing with one of the stableboys- Thomas Collins, he remembered, playing hide and seek in the fields. But then suddenly, a guard told him that his father wanted to see him and escorted him to the throne room. Uther had been particularly furious that day, his anger obviously directed at ten-year-old Arthur. &quot;You are not to spend your time playing in the fields like some...&quot; the man had lectured him for the next half an hour before promptly dismissing him to his rooms, ordering the blond to stay there for the rest of the day. The very next morning, Arthur had found that the stable boy, Thomas, had been sacked, and his family had moved to one of the villages far away from Camelot. Throughout his life, Uther made sure to not let Arthur get too close to any person. While he did allow occasional banter with Morgana and a few of his friends (Uther had handpicked them himself), he often warned him about getting too attached to anyone, cautioning him about the dangers. And whatever Uther wanted, Arthur did, making sure that all of his friends were apar with societal (Uther&#x27;s) standards of etiquette and propriety. Enter Merlin. His clumsy fool of a manservant. The man who has never failed to make a fool of himself in front of everyone and yet has proven to be so astonishingly loyal. The man who has called him an incorrigible prat and yet drank poison for him before one could spell clotpole. The man who has complained constantly about how being on a horse for a whole day was so uncomfortable yet has marched into battle along with him without second thoughts. The Merlin Arthur could never fathom out. While, there were not many people out there who were unaware of their somewhat unconventional master/servant relationship (even Uther had come to have a silent agreement with it), hell, some of them even dared to snicker when Merlin came up with one of his irritating nicknames to Arthur, some of them failed to understand how important Merlin was to him. Though there were people who understand them for who they are- friends (if Arthur admits so himself), many just thought of them to be a weird duo of a lenient master and a bumbling servant who loved stocks way too much for his own good. At first, Arthur had thought of them to be this bizarre duo too, had thought of himself to be this extremely forgiving master who may or may not enjoy the company of his incompetent manservant. But over time, he had come to see Merlin as something other than this bumbling servant. He hadn&#x27;t really realised when the line between the weird sense of loyalty and fondness blurred, and he found that he could not just label them as employer/employee anymore. It was just too impersonal, and the very idea of being just a master to Merlin became frankly repulsing. He couldn&#x27;t really find &quot;friends&quot; sufficient either, it was better, yes, but it was not just good enough. Nothing was ever good enough. Sometimes, late at night and in the privacy of his chambers, Arthur pondered about their constantly evolving relationship. About when he had started to feel the unflagging sense of loyalty towards his manservant. Had it been when Merlin had gulped the poison without a second thought or when Merlin had followed Arthur to the labyrinth? Or was it all the way back when he had saved him from the witch&#x27;s dagger? Arthur would never know. All he knew was that between the countless displays of undiluted loyalty and imperishable devotion and the odd moments of understanding, Merlin had woven his way into his life and had taken permanent residence in a private part of his heart- the one that was reserved for Merlin only. While he might not go ahead and admit his admiration for Merlin, heck, he didn&#x27;t even realise it himself most of the time- there were times when he does wonder what he did to receive the man&#x27;s undying loyalty and devotion. And whether he was actually worthy of any of it. There were times when Arthur found Merlin unexplainably withdrawn, unexplainably glum, and those times, according to Arthur, were the absolute worst. Because Arthur could deal with the usual cheerful, insubordinate Merlin, he could deal with the cold reservation and sarcastic jibes of an angry Merlin. What he couldn’t deal with was the melancholic eyes and the silent resignation of a sad Merlin. Unfortunately, that was Merlin&#x27;s mood most of the time these days. He shook his head to get rid of the thoughts that kept flooding back to him and glanced at his left, where Merlin was sleeping peacefully. His mouth parted, his nose scrunched, his eyebrows drawn together, and the fire illuminating his face in a way that made him look ethereal. Arthur sighed, breathing in some cool air, before turning to his side and screwing his eyes shut, hoping to get some sleep. A faint sound of soft sniffing woke Arthur up sometime during the night. He instinctively tensed and grabbed his sword, relaxing, only when he realised that Merlin was the source of the sound. He saw brunet, sitting hunched on a log, weeping uncontrollably, in a way that made his heart swell up with sorrow. He quietly made his way towards the boy, being extra careful so as to not wake any knights up. With a muttered &quot;Hey&quot; he slumped next to the boy, asking him what the matter was only to get incoherent mumblings as an answer. Not being able to see Merlin in such a condition, he wrapped his arms around Merlin in a way which Morgana used to do when he had nightmares as a child. He rocked him back and forth, hugging him to his chest and shushing him. After what seemed like an eternity, the dark-haired boy finally stopped crying and slowly pulled away from Arthur. “You okay?” Arthur whispered, rubbing soothing circles on the other boy’s back. “Yeah, thanks. You didn’t need to do it, though.” “Yeah, well, you should sleep we have a big day ahead.” The next morning he made his way to the tree where Merlin was tending to the horses, ready to ask him whatever he was so upset about last night. &quot;You want to talk about last night?&quot; &quot;Oh, yeah... just a bad dream, that&#x27;s all.” shrugged Merlin, before turning his attention back to the horses suspiciously quickly. “What do you take me for. It wasn’t a dream and don’t you dare say it was nothing, you were upset about something and I want to know what it was.” He said somewhat bitterly, something he regretted very soon as he saw Merlin’s shoulders slump. “I am sorry, Merlin. That was…” he started only to be cut by Merlin’s words. &quot;Do you remember the last Dragonlord, Balinor? He certainly wouldn&#x27;t have died if it weren&#x27;t for me. And well, I just... he didn&#x27;t deserve it. And it’s just that’s been… I have had a bit of trouble sleeping because of it…” Merlin rambled on, and normally, Arthur would have believed him, but he couldn’t right now as there was something in the man’s eyes that made him feel that he wasn’t telling the truth. Not the entire truth, at least. Arthur never really thought a lot about what he saw in Merlin&#x27;s eyes that day. Frankly, he hadn&#x27;t had enough time to read too much into it, as his duties had significantly increased since Morgana&#x27;s kidnapping. But it was also because thinking about it was too painful- that Merlin would lie to him about something while looking him in the eye. No, it was just too disheartening. He knew that Merlin might have his reasons for this and that those reasons might be valid (and he was not going to go ahead and investigate into the matter- cause he respected his friend&#x27;s boundaries and all), but it just hurt too much to think about. Juggling with the whole new set of duties did help- he now had a very rigid schedule, including going on patrols every other fortnight and spending a significant chunk of his time looking for clues regarding the sorceress, Morgause whereabouts. The good news was that Merlin soon returned to his usual cheerful self a few days after the encounter, and the two quickly resumed their friendly bantering and bickering. Almost a year later, Morgana was found wandering around in the forest, where a patrol had been stationed. Morgana&#x27;s arrival had brought a week of happiness to the kingdom, but the delight was short-lived as an undead army along with Cendred&#x27;s army set out to attack Camelot. Despite being attacked by two forces, at the same time, the fight ended rather quickly after Morgana discovered some sort of magical artefact beneath the castle, which she destroyed, winning them the battle. Following a few days, Arthur encountered a rigid Merlin, the one who followed the orders in a perfectly competent manner, just as an ideal servant should, in a way that a &quot;perfectly fine&quot; Merlin never was. The boy’s very presence had started to become uncomfortable as Merlin had turned into something distant, the hope in his eyes was missing, and the lightness of his voice was gone, substituted with passive rigidity. Throughout those days, Arthur desperately tried to corner Merlin, telling him he could trust him with anything and making sure that the boy was well, but the boy always slipped through his fingers- always claiming to be going back to chores or picking up herbs. It was only a few days after their historic victory when Arthur finally encountered Merlin properly. He viewed his manservant, who was deep in thought, not crying like he that night, but his rigidity was so similar in a way he wasn&#x27;t able to comprehend. The manservant was looking at the burial vaults where the apparent magical artefact had been placed, his face a picture of sorrow, pain, and guilt. “You alright?” Arthur coughed, startling Merlin, who immediately tried (and failed) to cover up the raw emotions on his face with the rigid mask he had on for the past few days. Arthur internally grimaced, thinking about how Merlin didn’t trust Arthur enough for him to show his emotions. “I am fine,” Merlin said, leaning against the cold stone of the walls. “You don’t look fine,” Arthur retorted before following Merlin, “Listen you don’t have to tell me anything. Just… just tell me what I can do to help you?” He smiled reassuringly when he saw Merlin’s eyes widen in disbelief and his lips curl into a small smile, his first smile in the past few weeks before he joked, “Well, you could give me a day off?” “I am trying to be serious over here,” Arthur rolled his eyes, “Really, while, I have no clue about what you are going through, I just don’t think there is nothing I can do to help you.” “Hmm… well, can you do what you did last time? At the forest.” Merlin mumbled under his breath. “You want me to hug you?” Arthur asked, unable to contain his excitement that something as simple as a hug from him could help cheer Merlin up. “Leave it, it’s stupid…” Merlin muttered, his eyes fixed on the scar that the lightening from the artefact left. “No, no… it isn’t stupid, it’s I am just surprised, that’s all.” He quickly said before wrapping his arms around Merlin’s middle just like he had on the other night, “Here, come here.” He spoke soothing words into Merlin’s back, delighted to hear Merlin humming near his ear, and rubbed his hands across his side until he felt the boy slump, his body losing all the rigidity. “That’s better,” he grinned when he felt Merlin contentedly smiling. “Now, you wanna race me back to my rooms,” Arthur said, already sprinting out of the chambers. “Hey! That’s just unfair!” Merlin yelled, following him nonetheless. The weeks that followed went by with little to no commotion. Merlin and Morgana were fine, Uther wasn&#x27;t questioning every decision he made, and everything was going smoothly. This all changed, though, when one day he heard some vague argument noises coming from the southern chambers, voices which he recognised as that of Merlin and Morgana&#x27;s. “You should… trust him; he will try his best to help you,” he heard Merlin say. As he peered through the slit, he could see Merlin and Morgana there. Morgana was holding up an accusing finger at the boy, who appeared to be in a defensive posture. As if she would ever hurt him - he huffed. “You are the last person to tell me who to trust Merlin,” came a reply. “This is not right. She is using you for her own…” Merlin started. “Why are you so…” “We were friends, Morgana,&quot; “Oh, friends,” he heard her scoff. Not wanting to eavesdrop anymore, Arthur dashed away from there, the very uncomfortable thoughts of whatever they were arguing about following him all the way to his chambers. As a few minutes passed, Arthur tried to figure out what was going on. They seemed to argue in an accusing way, nothing lighthearted, but in a way that people would after failed diplomatic meetings. The entire exchange made no sense to Arthur, Merlin telling Morgana that she should trust someone, and Morgana accusing Merlin of betraying her trust. It was all too vague to make any sense. Merlin appeared in his chambers about thirty minutes later, looking worn out from what Arthur could see from the argument. &quot;Merlin…” he coughed. &quot;Yes, Arthur,” the other boy&#x27;s reply echoed back. &quot;I heard you and Morgana fighting, but I couldn’t really make any sense out of it though.” The man&#x27;s eyes widened in surprise before he mumbled, “What did you hear?” “Nothing, much. Just something about trust and stuff- that is all.” He spoke, and Merlin only nodded. There was a heavy silence that settled on the both of them before Merlin asked, “Can I hug you?” “Yeah, of course!” The two men embraced, and Arthur could feel Merlin relaxing into the embrace before he pulled away, just a centimetre between them, “You don&#x27;t need to tell me anything you don’t want to.” “Thanks,” Merlin muttered before slipping away from the chambers. In the weeks following Merlin and Morgana&#x27;s argument, Morgana revealed her magic to Arthur, as well as the fact that Uther was her biological father. Both Arthur and Morgana had then had intense discussions with Uther, and both had taken months to forgive him. Following the discussions with his father and Morgana, he had asked Gwen, whether or not she knew anything about what was going on between Morgana and Merlin. “I don’t really know, Merlin says it was nothing and Morgana refuses to talk about it,” She had said. “Do you think Merlin knew about her magic and was that what they were discussing?” He had asked. “I think he might have. All we know for sure is that Morgause had been the one to poison her brain against us.” He had interrogated Gauis too but the man skilfully dodged his questions. In the end, Arthur had decided to leave the matter alone. A few months after Morgana had revealed her magic, Uther was assassinated by Odin’s men, and Arthur had been crowned king. Arthur&#x27;s very first act of kingship was repealing the ban on magic, and he installed Morgana to the position of Court Sorceress, an initiative to show her that Camelot was her home as well. Three months after Uther&#x27;s death and a fortnight after the magic ban repeal, Agravaine, Arthur&#x27;s uncle, had decided to attack him. It appeared that Morgause and Agravaine had formed an alliance and gathered a significant army against Camelot. Although their army was much smaller in comparison to Camelot&#x27;s, they had a number of magical artefacts at their disposal, which made them extremely powerful and dangerous. Both of them had been able to capture small portions of the outlying villages, and their future as allies had looked quite bright. He had discussed Camelot&#x27;s magical reinforcements with Morgana, but she had replied that not many of them remained; most had been destroyed during the purge. Arthur was sure that significant portions of Camelot would be captured and had tried to prepare for attack the best he could when the news of Agravaine&#x27;s sudden death reached him. Rumour had it that sorcery was involved and that Morgause had killed the man in cold blood so that she could use his army. However, most of their forces had been broken up and they were no good to anyone. On that particular night, after and during the celebrations, he had found Merlin uncharacteristically withdrawn and had then found him found Merlin sulking in the corner later that night. “Are you alright?” He questioned, wrapping his arms around the man&#x27;s torso, as they had agreed unspokenly. “Yes- Yes, it’s…” the brunet tried to explain exasperatedly. “You don’t have to say.” Arthur muttered in his neck, hoping that one day Merlin would trust him enough to confide in. The sun shone brightly in the sky as Merlin and Arthur bickered. They were passing through one of the villages where Agravaine and Morgause had set up their camp. It was one of the days following the spring when the air was full of freshness and flowers bloomed throughout the area. They were sitting near a picturesque river, and the view had been so captivating. And Arthur would have been getting some much-needed leisure if it wasn&#x27;t for Merlin, who seemed convinced that something was wrong with it. “Arthur,&quot; he repeated, &quot;I don’t think this place is safe.” “And why is that, Merlin ?” he smirked and rolled his eyes, starting to feel annoyed. “I have this weird feeling,” Merlin just replied just when Morgause appeared. &quot;Good to see you here, Arthur.&quot; the woman sneered, holding her hand up and muttering incantations before a force knocked her out. A force that came from Merlin. He looked around to see the man, his hand stretched in front of him, his eyes golden. &quot;What are you...&quot; he muttered before realisation sunk in. Merlin was a sorcerer. Merlin had magic. His Merlin had magic. Merlin had not trusted him enough to tell him about his magic. The words reverberated in his brain, a broken &#x27;Arthur&#x27; from Merlin shaking him out of his stupor. &quot;I use it for you, Arthur. Only for you.&quot; the boy spoke, his voice coming in broken whispers. &quot;Come on&quot; Arthur mumbled, not daring to look at Merlin. Although Arthur often made fun of Merlin&#x27;s cowardice and how he hid behind the trees during battles, he never really meant any of it. Arthur had thought Merlin was the bravest man he knew. Merlin’s source of bravery had always been a mystery to him. He had never really been able to figure out why Merlin, a simple peasant boy, had as much courage as him most of the time, if not more. Now, when he pondered into it, he realised that it had been magic all along. That Merlin was not all defenceless as he appeared. That there was more to Merlin than met the eye. That Merlin was a sorcerer and a powerful one if Morgause’s corpse was anything to go by. The thing he didn’t understand was why Merlin hadn’t confessed that he had magic after seeing everything he had done to make like better for people with magic. After all, he had done to amend for his father’s mistake, Merlin still hadn’t trusted him enough to tell him about his magic. Did he not think that Arthur would understand why he had kept it a secret all those years, had he not trusted him enough… Arthur shivered at the very thought. He glanced towards Merlin who was seated on the rock beside him, looking warily at Arthur. “What are you going to do?” Merlin squinted. “About you, you mean.” Arthur bitterly stated. “Yeah” the warlock exhaled. “Well, magic is legal in Camelot, so no harm can come to you legally. Also all you killed was an enemy to the state…” he rambled, knowing that it wasn’t what Merlin meant. “You know that’s not what I meant.” “I don’t understand… you know, why didn’t you tell me?” He questioned. “You would have chopped my head off.” Merlin chuckled dryly. “Magic has been legal for three years now. Why didn’t you tell me?” “I wanted to…” “Then why didn’t you?” “I didn’t want you to think any less of me.” Merlin whispered, looking small in a way that Arthur just wanted to bundle him up and tell him that it was okay, that Arthur had forgiven him, but he couldn’t just do that right now, not when he needed to understand. Arthur would never think any less of Merlin, magic or not, he really respected and loved the man for his courage and bravery. He can’t really imagine how living in a kingdom that killed you for being you felt like. Furthermore, he wasn&#x27;t really going to even think of Merlin as less because he was a sorcerer. Morgana had magic, and her loyalty and devotion to Camelot were unparalleled. It was true that she had once taken up the dark side, but that wasn&#x27;t really the case anymore, and he knew that fear and misdirection had caused her paranoia, not magic. Additionally, he never really had any doubts about Merlin’s loyalty, he knew that the boy didn’t even have a single evil bone in his body. The very thought that Merlin would think that of him… was frustrating. “Why would I think any less of you… That’s absurd… why would I think any less of you. My sister has magic.” He finally blurted out. “That I had magic and I… well, I don’t really look like the powerful warlock I am right. And that I chose to serve you despite all the power and… that it’s pathetic.” Merlin trailed off, his eyes fixed on the fire as both of them let a blanket of silence fall upon them. Minutes elapsed by, and they might as well have been hours before Arthur dared to look at Merlin, who had been sitting with his rigid stance all along. “Listen, I want you to know that I am not angry with you, I am upset, maybe a bit disappointed but I am not angry.” He awkwardly coughed. “So, you are not going to banish me or anything…” “Banish you, I don’t think I can live without you.” “What?” “Yes…” “Good, cause, I don’t think that I can live without you either.” Merlin offered him the briefest of smiles. He looked into Merlin’s eyes then only to find the pools of blue swimming with devotion and desire. Their gazes locked before Merlin’s hand rested against his cheek, slowly brushing his skin. His eyes flickered to Merlin’s lips, and he wondered, as he had done hundreds of times before, about how those plump lips would feel against his. Would they be as smooth as they looked, or would they be chappy from all the chewing? His eyes locked with Merlin’s once more as both the men shifted on the hard floor of the cave. “Can I kiss you?” He heard Merlin whisper. He nodded before leaning forward and brushing his lips against the other boy&#x27;s. The touch was barely there yet it was electrifying, sending shiver down his spine. They pulled away the other second, their eyes full of understanding for one another. “I think we should talk first.” Arthur mumbled, his hand resting against the other boy’s shoulder. “Yeah, I think we should.” Merlin replied. Five days passed before they decided to have the much-needed conversation. Those five days were probably among the most awkward one&#x27;s Arthur had ever experienced. The two danced around each other at first, refusing to acknowledge what had happened back in the cave, until Merlin finally conceded the situation. “Did you not mean it?” Merlin had asked while serving him breakfast, and Arthur could do nothing but shake his head in refusal. Their conversation had covered their relationship, where things would lead, and everything Merlin had accomplished in those years, from slaying the beast to dodging arrows during battlements. How Merlin had been continued to protect him without any acknowledgement, just like a guardian angel. They had discussed several difficult topics, such as how Merlin had let the dragon live, or how he had poisoned Morgana, a decision he deeply regretted. They had talked about all of it. A few days later both of them had come to the conclusion that it would be prudent for them to utilise Merlin’s abilities in a way that would be practical and be far more advantageous for the kingdom. Merlin had started helping Morgana in her duties and had started teaching young magicians. Over the months, Arthur had figured out how endearing he found Merlin doing magic. How he softly whispered the spells and how his eyes turned golden- it was just like Merlin was a fae. His favourite times had been when Merlin cast something in the sky- be it a golden dragon or a blue unicorn, Arthur simply loved them. He loved how Merlin’s magic circled and enveloped him like a warm blanket. The feeling was... unworldly. When Merlin had told him about the destiny thing that the dragon beneath the castle had told him, he had almost not believed in it. He had thought of it to be a prank that Gwen and Morgana had put him up to, that was until he confirmed it with Alator, one of Morgana’s finest and wisest men. “Emrys is prophesied to bring about the time the poets speak of,” the man had spoken in a surprisingly gentle voice, “the golden age of Albion. The time of the Once and the Future King and Emrys.” Later that night, he had pondered upon what those words meant. It did explain most of the things he had felt for Merlin before his feelings had come into the picture. How Arthur started to feel a sense of belongingness to Merlin (something he had realised after he fought Valiant), why Arthur had felt this odd sense of accomplishment whenever he made Merlin smile, why he thought that there was a connection between them. Now he knew why because he was incomplete without Merlin and how Merlin was incomplete without him. “You have no idea about the number of nights I’ve spent trying to figure… what we are” He expressed one night when they were both in bed too exhausted to do anything. “I don’t know, lovers…” Merlin muttered, his eyelids drooping as he snuggled deeper into the blankets. “I figured that out…” Arthur rolled his eyes, “I just think… that all this… like we were meant to be.” “Like we were destined to be together.” Merlin stated with a tone that might have a mixture of realisation, astonishment and contentment. Well, that or a yawn. “Yeah…” “Someone once told me we were like two sides of the same coin. I am the brighter side, obviously.” Merlin mumbled, turning to his side and falling to sleep not a second later. Sleep didn’t come easy to Arthur that night as he reminisced all those nights he had spent wide awake wondering what Merlin was to him. It didn’t really seem significant to him right now, not when Merlin was by his side, not when he was by Merlin’s. He remembered all those times Merlin had shown him to be vulnerable in front of him and all those times he had not. He remembered all those times when he had shown his vulnerable side in front of Merlin, he remembered how Merlin had trusted in him when no one else had. He glanced at the man in question, who was now sleeping peacefully by his. The blond closed his eyes which were now heavy with sleep, recalling all the hours he had spent wondering whether he would find any sufficient label for them. All the time he had spent trying to find something good enough. Two sides of the same coin, Arthur thought just before sleep claimed him , that might just be the closest to good enough .</span> <a href="#" class="summary-toggle">[ + ]</a></div><div class="stats"><div class="stat-item"><strong>Rating:</strong> Teen And Up Audiences</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Archive Warning:</strong> No Archive Warnings Apply</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Category:</strong> M/M</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Fandom:</strong> Merlin (TV)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Relationship:</strong> Merlin/Arthur Pendragon (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Character:</strong> Merlin (Merlin), Arthur Pendragon (Merlin), Gwen (Merlin), Morgana (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Additional Tags:</strong> Alternate Universe - Canon Divergence, Good morgana, Merlin&#x27;s Magic Revealed (Merlin), Golden Age, Morgana&#x27;s Magic Revealed (Merlin), Uther Pendragon&#x27;s A+ Parenting (Merlin), Fluff, i think, 4+1 kinda things, Minor Character Death, Soft Arthur Pendragon (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Published:</strong> 2022-01-21</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Words:</strong> 4792</div></div></div><div class="work-entry"><h2 class="title"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://download.archiveofourown.org/downloads/24588574/Hungry%20Arthur%20ART.pdf?updated_at=1609907060" target="_blank">Hungry Arthur (ART)</a></h2><div class="summary">Merlin is a kitten.

Notes Okay, this prompt took a little longer to write than I was expecting, but I had a lot of fun with it. Anyway, we are at the last day of this collection! I just want to thank the people who created this challenge because it was a lot of fun to do and helped me write a wider variety than I am used to. I also want to thank everyone who has been reading all of the fics and has been enjoying them all because i really appreciate you guys and our comments made my day. And a special thank you to my best friend who has been helping me and has been encouraging me to get these prompts done. Love you! Prompt: Free day + Magic reveal I hope y&#x27;all enjoy! See the end of the work for more notes Iron, in Merlin’s humble opinion, smells horrid. And not horrid as in “the stocks&#x27;&#x27; horrid. No, no rotten smell here. It’s not horrid like the stables either (though the stables soon becomes an acquired smell that most people are able to ignore). It is horrid in that it has no definitive smell at all. It feels cold. Merlin can definitely feel its solid weight hanging from his wrists, but iron smells like nothing he can find to identify it with. It smells sharp. Now isn’t that odd to say. Never has Merlin ever met anything and imagined it to smell sharp. But that’s iron. There’s this hint of something. Something that makes his nostrils flare, so his brain decided that that is what a sharp smell is. “Oh stop moping, Mer lin,” Arthur hisses next to him. Both of them are shackled by some actually competent bandits who ambushed them while they were on a hunt. “I’ll get us out of here in no time.” “Oh sure you will. Not to be rude, your majesty,” Merlin grits through his teeth, “but you have been saying that for the past hour. Unfortunately-” Merlin gestures (as well as a shackled man can when bound and thrown on top of a decomposing log) to the bandits’ campsite “-it appears that time has been made, and we are still here.” Arthur rolls his eyes and grumbles some (probably unfavorable) words under his breath. The campsite has a nice fire going at the center which is too far a distance for Merlin to feel its warmth. He shivers as the winds pick up a bit as the day continues to grow shorter. The bandits are laughing at something (Merlin isn’t paying much attention) while they enjoy a nice meal of a stag (Arthur’s stag that he hunted and killed himself, and Merlin just knows he is miffed about it.) “Merlin.” When the fuck did Arthur get so close? His face is mere inches from Merlin’s and Merlin hates that he squeaked because of it. Arthur sighs at his manservant for what might be the upteenth time today. He would rake his hand through his hair but, like Merlin, is shackled from his wrists to his feet. First and foremost, he needs to find a way to get these chains off him. “Merlin.” Arthur licks his lips (Merlin is not distracted at all). “Think you can reach towards my belt and find my dagger?” “What, were the bandits competent enough to shackle us, but not enough to separate you from your weapons?” He raises an eyebrow as he leans near Arthur’s belt ( holy shit, holy shit, this was a bad idea, abort abort abort-) Merlin gives out a sound of triumph and pulls out (rather recklessly) Arthur’s dagger. “Guess they’re not as competent as we thought,” Merlin remarks cheekily while dangling the blade in plain sight. “No, but neither are you.” He takes the dagger from Merlin. “Seriously, Merlin, anyone could have seen that! Do you have an inch of self preservation at all?” It was meant to be a rhetorical question. Arthur wasn’t waiting on an answer, and Merlin knew that. So, why in heaven’s name did Merlin think to answer it anyway? “Well, of course I do when I am at risk of execution almost everyday!” They both freeze when the words finally register in their minds. “I’m sorry what?” “Um...I- well, nothing! Uh, dagger! Why do you need the dagger?” Ignoring the very blatantly troubling response and filing it for later (as in as soon as they are far away from danger and Arthur can hound on him on what exactly Merlin means by having his life at risk everyday), Arthur brings the dagger back and motions at Merlin. “Give me your wrists.” Merlin gives them. “Now, this shouldn’t take too long. Just a bit longer and-” They both hear a click sound from the iron cuff and Merlin’s wrists are free. Just having the iron off his skin is enough to make Merlin weep. Instead, he breathes out a sigh of relief. Merlin never liked iron, and not just for its horrid smell. For some reason, iron has always found a way to make him feel weak. Gaius mentioned it could be because of how iron is a repellant of magic, so for someone with an abundance of magic like Merlin, iron can be a dangerous thing to hold against him. Thankfully, the iron on these chains were more rust than pure cold iron, but he felt its draining effects anyway. Arthur hands the dagger to Merlin, and he takes the hint. Unlike Arthur, Merlin isn’t used to being shackled and seen as a ransom target, so his skills for when it comes to picking locks is lackluster. “You are really taking you time.” “Shut up, sir prat. I could just leave you here since I’m free and all.” “Of course you would.” Arthur is grinning at him. It’s not helping Merlin’s situation any better. If anything, Arthur’s terrible, inappropriate (beautiful) smile is doing wonders at keeping Merlin from achieving his task. Which might soon become a problem since the bandits have finished ignoring their captives and chose now to check up on them. Course, Merlin had no clue since his back was towards them and Arthur was busy...doing other things. “What do yeh think yer doin’?” asks the lanky one who has quite a variety of piercings if Merlin does say so himself. “Uh, well-I was, um...holding his hand…?” Damnit, Merlin, no wonder Gaius always said you went to the tavern. Merlin can see Arthur’s eyes praying for something to just eat him alive and honestly, Merlin prays that too. The lanky bandit smirks and inches closer to the two of them. “Really?” His eyes glance down to Merlin&#x27;s bare wrists, and he snaps his fingers. Great. The bandit behind him bounds over. This one is a complete contrast to the lanky one. He is wide and buff with a fur coat covering his torso. Very efficiently, the buff one grabs Merlin and pulls him up from the ground. “Hey, that hurts! Let me go!” “Leave him alone! He has no part in this.” The lanky one turns back to Arthur with a smile. It’s an awful one. His teeth are all grimy and some leftover venison can be seen peeking out from between the bandit’s teeth. “Ah, I don’t think so, highness. See, we don’t take too kindly to those thinkin’ they can outsmart us.” The buff on grips Merlin a little tighter, who tries his best not to make a sound. However, Arthur has always been good at picking up on all of Merlin’s tells. He can see the amount of pain his manservant is in and feels helpless since he is still in chains and can barely move his arms. “Now, let’s say we teach the servant boy a lesson.” The lanky bandit’s smile turns predatory and faces Merlin. Merlin glares back, his chin held up high with that entrancing fire burning inside his eyes. Lanky Bandit turns back to Arthur. This time with a knife. He can see Merlin struggle against Buff Bandit’s hold, but when it comes to Merlin&#x27;s barely there strength and the strength of a more muscular guy, it’s a losing game. “The instructions were to bring you back alive,” Lanky Bandit hums, “but they never said unharmed.” His eyes look slightly more crazed than before and Arthur is powerless to stop the man from coming any closer, still shackled from his wrist to his ankles. “Touch a hair on his head, and I&#x27;ll make you pay for it tenfold,” Merlin growls in his struggle to be free from the buff bandit. The lanky one laughs as he crouches down to Arthur’s level. Apparently, his breath smells worse than he could have ever imagined. And Arthur thought seeing his teeth before was bad. “And how are you going to do that, servant boy?” Arthur has an impulsive thought to correct the bandit. That is not just some servant boy, that is my most trusted friend. He pushes the thought back though. Best not to give the bandit more fuel to use against them. The knife is near his right eye. The bandit keeps his unnerving smile on, and Arthur keeps his blank. Unharmed or not, Arthur is not giving this scumbag any satisfaction from seeing him in pain. Merlin shouted again not to hurt him, and Arthur can’t help but feel warm from it. He shouldn’t need to. Arthur’s been through worse. They both know that, but seeing Merlin care and be worried for him always seems to throw Arthur off. The knife swipes away from his face, but Arthur knows the bandit only moved it back to slash at him. He sees the arm draw back. He hears Merlin&#x27;s screams, and sees the knife racing towards him. It is mere inches away until it and the lanky bandit are ripped away from him by some unseeable force. Wrong. Merlin found a way to get free from the buff bandit and is now glaring at the other one with such a fury. His eyes are a light with gold. Oh gods, gold! He can feel the wind pick up and whip up around him until it encircles Merlin and the lanky bandit. Well, of course I do when I am at risk of execution almost everyday! Oh Merlin. His dear, sweet Merlin. “I told you,” Merlin’s growl sounds more like an echo. “Don’t.” The wind howled harder. “Touch him.” From behind, the buff bandit runs up to attack, but before Arthur can even get a word in, Merlin stretches a hand behind him and throws the bandit back until he hits a nearby tree. Arthur thinks he heard a snap, but it could just be from the harsh winds. The other bandit cowers on the ground, mumbling and bubbling some kind of apology, but it’s hard to hear over the wind. Just like the other one, Merlin stretches out his arm and the lanky one is thrown back. From a distance, Arthur can see the rest of the bandit gang fleeing from their campsite until it’s just the two of them. The wind dies down and Arthur watches as Merlin’s eyes go from molten gold back to their light blue hue. Cautiously, Merlin walks over to the still shackled Arthur and looks down at his king. Arthur is frozen still. Just before, Merlin looked murderous and full of rage. Now, Arthur can see the tells of a Merlin who is uncertain and scared. To be honest, Arthur doesn’t like that at all and wants to fix that. “Are you just going to keep me like this?” That seems to wake up his Merlin. He blinks and looks at Arthur and flushes. “Sorry, I’ll get right to it, sire.” Merlin murmurs a spell and Arthur sees Merlin&#x27;s eyes flash from blue to gold back to blue. It was shocking, but not uncomfortable. The chains fall off and the powerlessness Arthur felt before is long gone. He stands up and grabs Merlin by the arm and looks right at him. “Thank you, Merlin.” Something in Merlin&#x27;s eyes flash passed but it’s too quick for Arthur to identify. However, he can spot the tears beginning to form under his eyes. Just this once, Arthur allows Merlin a hug. It was a little stiff at first since Merlin held onto him so tightly, but he soon began to loosen and brushed his nose against his manservant’s hair. &quot;Arthur-Arthur, I&#x27;m sorry, I...I couldn&#x27;t let them hurt you. I couldn&#x27;t. Arthur--&quot; “It’s alright, Merlin. I’m fine.” They stay like that for a while before gathering their bearings and heading back to the castle. It’s not until much later that Merlin tells Arthur everything he knows and what he’s been through since coming to camelot. And despite Arthur claiming that he would only allow Merlin that one hug, he eventually began to let Merlin hug him whenever needed. It’s the least he can do. Besides, Merlin gives the best hugs in Arthur&#x27;s opinion. End Notes okay, I have been seeing a lot of BAMF!Merlin edits so I wanted to write that for the magic reveal prompt, but this is also my first time writing Merlin being a badass instead of a soft bean, so i hope I did him justice.

Arthur being furious and betrayed, and then, later, after it all clicks, accepting Merlin for who he is. Arthur ought to have died. He was prepared to, in the end. But Merlin ‒ brilliant Merlin ‒ saves him with his magic, and he lives on. It’s wondrous. Perfect. Like something straight out of a fairy tale. Arthur rides back to Camelot, best friend at his side, after three or so days of falling in and out of sleep on the way home. He shows up at the steps of the castle like a figure of legend. He embraces his queen and greets his knights and the people give shouts of adoration at his miraculous survival. And yet. The night of his return, Arthur lies in bed, the soft mattress and pillow almost discomforting after his harrowing journey through the woods with Merlin. But more unsettling than anything is the feeling that grips him as the night grows dark. It’s so very heavy. Visceral. Frightening. Gaius gives him a draught to help ease the pain of his recovery ‒ Merlin’s magic may have healed him, but he still feels like utter shit ‒ as well as aid his sleep, and yet Arthur finds he does not feel the least bit tired. He stares up at the canopy that hangs above him. He thinks: it’s red as blood. Like the blood that had soaked his body, hot and slithering under his armor, by the time Merlin brought him to the treeline, where he’d collapsed, unable to move on. He thinks of it now, closing his eyes and letting the memory fill his mind. The feeling gets heavier yet. “I’m not going to lose you.” Merlin’s voice is desperation and terror, hidden under a veneer of bravado. “Just, just….just hold me.” That’s Arthur. And then: “Thank you.” Arthur reaches up. Grips the back of Merlin’s head with his shaking, dying palm. Then his vision spots, and everything is going black. And then Merlin is saying “stay with me” in this voice that Arthur’s never heard him use before. Not for him. And he comes to for a moment, because in the midst of all the incoherent thoughts and images whirling around in his fading mind, he thinks that he’d probably crawl from the pits of hell itself to hear that voice again. But Arthur isn’t that strong. It all goes black anyways, and it’s by Merlin’s strength alone ‒ by his fucking inability to let Arthur come to any sort of harm, let alone death ‒ that he’s brought back from the brink. Arthur’s eyes snap open. He stares at the blood-red canopy. That feeling arises in his chest, and it’s so completely terrifying, so impossible, and he can’t look it in the face. He can’t. He can’t. [I’m not going to lose you. Stay with me. Just hold me.] Until, in this moment, he does. He sits up in bed, reaches over the side, grabs the pot that Gaius had set down next to it and retches until his throat bleeds. Merlin is there when he wakes the next morning. The first shafts of daylight sneak in through the gaps in the curtains, casting slivers of gold on the floor. Merlin has brought a chair from his table over to Arthur’s bedside, where he sits with his legs tucked into his chest. His eyes are open, but his head is turned to the side, and he has yet to notice that Arthur has awoken. He looks exhausted, to put it lightly. There are deep, dark circles under his eyes. His hair is ruffled and his clothes are a wrinkled mess. Abruptly, Arthur is reminded of another moment in time, where Merlin had looked much the same. “I didn’t want you to feel that you were alone.” He thinks about that look he’d seen in Merlin’s eyes ‒ the sheer devotion ‒ and bites his lip, closing his own eyes and feeling a million different emotions hit him all at once. All this time. Ten years of Merlin protecting him with magic, with Arthur none the wiser. He thinks of all the hell Merlin has had to go through alone, thinks of the fear and the shame he must’ve felt, and now Arthur is feeling ill again. He shifts uncomfortably from the nausea that arises in him, and Merlin, of course, notices the movement, his head immediately turning, eyes snapping up to meet Arthur’s. “Arthur,” he says. It’s just one word ‒ one name ‒ and yet Merlin somehow manages to fit so much feeling into it that it makes Arthur’s chest twist with something unnameable. He thinks of the night before, then. Of his realization that perhaps he can put a name to that feeling, and the chamber pot next to the bed. He thinks to himself: you’re the fucking king, Arthur Pendragon. Push it down, down, down. “Merlin,” he responds. His lips quirk up in the smallest of smiles, and he’s prepared to say some sort of clever quip ‒ I see you’ve forgotten my breakfast yet again, or you’re looking worse than me, and I nearly just died ‒ but what comes out is: “I’m sorry.” He’s not sure why he’s said it, to be honest. He only knows that it feels right. Merlin looks sad and tired and after everything they’ve been through together, Arthur can’t bring himself to utter anything that isn’t an apology. Merlin’s eyebrows pull together, just so. He shakes his head, and his legs fall to the floor as he shifts closer to Arthur. “No, no, Arthur. I’m sorry. You ‒ I ‒ all this time, I’ve been lying to you, deceiving you. I never wanted to, I swear, but I did, and I’m so, so ‒ ” Somehow, Arthur garners enough energy to put a hand in the air, effectively cutting Merlin off. “Stop. Apologizing. Merlin.” Reluctantly, Merlin’s mouth snaps shut. His blue eyes widen slightly, and it occurs to Arthur that Merlin is scared. Surely he doesn’t still think that Arthur is going to harm him? He can’t even think of the other word, of what must’ve been Merlin’s real fear all these years. Images flash in his mind, of fire and an axe, of blood and screaming and Merlin and fuck ‒ Arthur manages to choke out “chamber pot,” and Merlin scrambles out of the chair, grabbing it and thrusting it into Arthur’s arms just in time. He’s got nothing in his stomach after the night before, so he just dry heaves for a bit until the wave of sickness passes, leaving him shaky and sweaty. And then Merlin is there, chair abandoned, kneeling by Arthur’s bedside. He reaches out, as if to brush Arthur’s sweat-soaked hair back from his forehead, but hesitates. His hand falls back to his side and he stands up, backing away a bit. Arthur is struck, then, with a sudden, inexplicable flash of anger, and before he can think better of it he snaps, “You can touch me, Merlin. I’m not going to…” He trails off, but they both know what he meant to say. Hurt you. As if Arthur could ever do anything remotely close to truly hurting Merlin. As if he wouldn’t walk to the very ends of the earth to strike down anyone who’d dare to do so. As if I haven’t already, Arthur thinks, recalling all of the times he’d dashed off towards danger to save his manservant’s life. And then that gets him wondering how many times Merlin has saved his life, and then Arthur’s looking up at Merlin, who’s still standing by his bedside looking like a startled deer, and he says, “I thought we’d settled this.” Frowning a little, Merlin reaches out, taking the chamber pot from Arthur and setting it on the ground before sitting back down in his chair. He scoots it up, closer to the bed. The tension in Arthur’s chest loosens, just a bit. “What do you mean?” Arthur rolls his eyes. “Come on. You know.” He waves a hand meaninglessly, leaning back to sit against his pillows. “I don’t, actually,” Merlin says, but the vaguely daring look in his eyes makes his words moot. Arthur sighs. Of course Merlin is going to make him say it. He wouldn’t expect anything less, and although it’s a bit irritating, he can’t help but be relieved by the reappearance of Merlin’s stubbornness. It’s what got us into this mess, after all, Arthur thinks. More images flash in his mind, and this time, it’s of a younger version of Merlin, foot resting on a fallen target and a playful smirk on his lips. “What are you going to do to me?” “You have no idea.” Arthur looks into Merlin’s unyielding gaze and realizes just how right he was, from the very beginning. “Your magic,” he says, finally. He’s proud when the words come out strong and unwavering. Something lightens up Merlin’s face ‒ a brief flash of pride, maybe. He’s silent, though, giving Arthur room to think and speak his mind. It’s still a hell of a lot to deal with, after all. He can’t even begin to imagine everything he doesn’t know. All of the secrets. The lies. The word deception slithers into his mind, and that sense of betrayal is still there, it would seem, hiding underneath his other feelings of guilt and shame and ‒ Arthur sucks in a quiet breath. Down, down, down. “I know you’re still upset, Arthur.” He looks up to see Merlin gazing at him. And although there’s a deep sadness written in the lines of his face, there’s also a whole lot of understanding. “I would be,” he continues. He pulls his knees back up to his chest, wrapping his arms around them. His gaze flits away from Arthur’s, fixing on something unseen. “If it were the other way around, and I found out you were...lying...to me, for so long, I’d…” He sighs. “I know I’d be hurt.” His eyes meet Arthur’s once more, and the intensity in them is hot enough that Arthur almost wants to look away. He doesn’t. “I understand if you want to take it back.” Arthur frowns. “Take what back?” Merlin shifts uncomfortably. “You know. Your...acceptance. Of me. Of my magic.” When Arthur doesn’t say anything ‒ he’s too busy being railed by waves of pure guilt, yet again ‒ he adds, “You were dying, after all. It’s only natural that you’d say things you might not truly mean.” Arthur’s heart clenches at that, and he realizes that he wants to ask ‒ did you? Did Merlin say things he didn’t mean, simply because Arthur was dying? When he whispered stay with me in that broken voice, was it real? When he touched his hand, so gentle, to Arthur’s cheek that night by the campfire, was it only to comfort a man who was not long for this world? “I meant it.” Merlin’s eyes widen and his lips part, and he’s staring at Arthur as if he’s just retrieved the moon from the sky and is holding it out to him in his palm, saying take it, please. “Really?” It’s barely a whisper. “Really.” Something in Merlin changes, then. His entire body seems to relax, and he sinks back into the chair, uncurling his legs and offering Arthur a soft smile. “Thank you, Arthur.” It’s not unlike Arthur’s own thank you ‒ filled with all the knowledge of what has passed between them. And not unlike Arthur’s own thank you, it sounds a lot like something else entirely. Arthur rests for a total of three days before he finally gets antsy in a way that can’t be simply ignored. Much to the chagrin of Merlin and Guinevere and Gaius ‒ and, well, everyone ‒ he gets out of bed on the fourth morning with thunder in his eyes and says, “I’m perfectly well, now. I’m the King of Camelot and I have duties to attend to.” He still feels a bit tired, but Gaius’s draughts are enough to help him get through the days that follow. He spends most of them in council meetings, sitting at his usual spot at the round table and discussing post-battle plans and arrangements. Guinevere sits on his right, and it’s a blessed comfort to have her there. Her mere presence ‒ calm, yet shining with love and strength ‒ is enough to help ease the stress that he feels as he orders funeral ceremonies for those who fell in the battle (he thinks of Gwaine and his heart twists ), as he figures out the best foreign policies going forward. Yet, as he catches her eye for the fifth or so time one day, about an hour into a meeting, he’s overcome with a sudden twist of guilt as he remembers the night of his return to Camelot, of the feelings that became so clear and apparent in one single moment. He reaches for Gwen’s hand under the table and squeezes it, offering her a soft smile. She returns it unwaveringly, completely unaware of the quiet turmoil that has begun to stir in his gut. Releasing Gwen’s hand, he turns to his left, and as Sir Leon continues on about his proposal of a celebration to raise citizen morale, sees Merlin shift from the corner of his eye. It’s just a glimpse of red and grey, of his light brown jacket, but it’s enough to compel Arthur to, almost unknowingly, subconsciously, turn his head, meeting Merlin’s eyes full on. His place is normally behind Arthur, a few feet back, but today he’s opted to instead stand up against the stone wall to Arthur’s left. When their eyes catch, his mouth tilts up in the smallest of reassuring smiles, probably assuming that this is all Arthur really wants ‒ reassurance. After all, Merlin’s given it a thousand times before, whether in the council chambers or on the battlefield or huddled around the campfire in the midst of a dangerous quest. But that’s not what Arthur is after, because he keeps looking at his manservant, without even really knowing why. Merlin’s small smile fades, and something a lot like curiosity, mixed with a bit of concern, flits across his face. “...sire?” Arthur jumps, head turning, eyes snapping back to Leon. The red haired knight is giving him a puzzled look. In fact, now that Arthur is actually paying attention, he realizes that almost everyone seated at the table is wearing the same expression, all laced with varying degrees of concern. He can’t help it; his face flushes at being caught looking, and then comes the panic. He looks at each of them in turn, almost assessing, as if he could somehow decipher if any of them know. “Are you alright, my lord?” Leon asks. And it’s a well-meaning question, really, and Leon is one of Arthur’s most trusted knights, but his question, on top of all the fussing that everyone has been doing over him, on top of being caught staring at his manservant ‒ it’s enough to make him hot with sudden anger. “I’m quite alright, Sir Leon,” he bites out, not even attempting to conceal the venom in his voice. “In fact, I’d greatly appreciate it if you all treated me as what I am. That is, your king. Not some wounded child.” He narrows his eyes, casting his gaze around the table, meeting each of his advisors’ eyes individually. “Is that clear?” There are a number of nods and an uneven chorus of yes, sire and of course, my lord, and the meeting proceeds as is typical, albeit a bit more tense than usual. All the while, Merlin stands up against the wall. And although Arthur isn’t looking at him, he can feel his manservant’s eyes on him. When Arthur dismisses the meeting about a half hour later, he gets up and strides from the council hall without a backward glance. That evening, Arthur realizes, quite out of nowhere, that he wants to know everything. He’s already put some of it together. Merlin’s magic is the perfect puzzle piece, fitting in perfectly and smoothing out all of the rough edges of the last ten years he and his manservant have spent together. All of that “good luck,” all of the convenient branches fallen atop of enemies, all of the times Arthur has been miraculously brought back from the brink of death ‒ the latest incident not even included. It was all Merlin. He knows it. Yet he wants to hear Merlin say it. He wants the details, wants to hear Merlin’s side of it all. Because he’d be lying if he said he’s not still feeling a bit betrayed, and there are approximately a thousand questions that he’s spent the last few days turning over and over in his mind while turning over and over on his mattress, unable to fall asleep. He needs an in-depth explanation. He needs the complete truth. So, as the evening sweeps darkness over the streets of Camelot, Arthur sends a servant to summon Merlin to his chambers. Then, he pulls two chairs from his table, over to the fireplace. It crackles softly, a bit pitiful, not having been stoked in hours, and Arthur thinks: I’ll have Merlin fix it when he gets here. The thought is instinctual, but it’s followed by a quiet sort of shock that he would ask Merlin ‒ Merlin, who is a sorcerer, and gods, that’s still strange to think ‒ to use his magic so casually after years of watching men and women be executed for the very same thing. He thinks of all the years he spent by his father’s side, watching weeping people ‒ children ‒ go to the chopping block, or the stake, using their very last words to swear y our majesty, I meant no harm, I meant no harm! How many innocent lives were lost to his father’s hatred? But that’s making it too easy. That’s laying the blame elsewhere, when Arthur knows good and well that by doing nothing, he may as well have executed those people himself. He wonders, not for the first time since Merlin revealed his magic, what would have happened if his manservant had gotten caught while Uther had been king. Then, perhaps it’s silly to wonder at all, because Arthur knows, deep down, no matter how much he wants to deny it, that his father would have had Merlin killed without a second thought. Arthur could’ve pleaded, begged on his knees, and it wouldn’t have made a difference. He realizes he has no idea how to reconcile these two pictures of his father: the man who ruthlessly executed innocents, and the man who would’ve died for his son in an instant, who loved him more than Camelot, even. But did he? After all, if Uther had truly loved Arthur more than Camelot, then surely he would have spared Merlin for his sake? For if Merlin had died at his father’s hand, Arthur knows he could have never found it within himself to forgive him. Would Uther have been willing to lose Arthur for the sake of his crusade against sorcery? He sinks into the chair by the fireplace, puts his head into his hands, and realizes with a deep pain that he’ll never get an answer. He’s not sure he wants one. There’s a tentative knock at the door. “Come in.” It opens and shuts with a soft swoosh, the familiar sound of Merlin’s boots against the stone floors of his chambers echoing in the quiet castle air. Arthur doesn’t move. He stays bent over, elbows on his knees, head in his hands. He hears Merlin walk over to the cabinet by his bed, hears him pull out a jug and two cups before pattering back over to the table. There’s the quiet trickle of wine being poured, and then, a moment later, Merlin’s presence by his side. Familiar. Warm, almost, although Arthur supposes that could be the fire. Which reminds him. Arthur leans up, sitting back in his chair and fixing Merlin with a hard look. “Light the fire.” Merlin holds out a cup of wine, which Arthur gratefully takes, and quirks a single eyebrow. There’s the barest hint of amusement in his dark blue eyes. “It’s already lit.” Arthur waves the hand that isn’t holding his cup and takes a long drink. Heaven knows he’ll need it to get through this. “You know what I mean. Make it...stronger.” Merlin chuckles, and it’s a soft sound, but it does the job of easing the tension well enough. “Warmer, you mean?” “Yes, Merlin ‒ hotter, bigger, better. Whatever.” He takes another drink and watches as Merlin moves to the fireplace and bends down, reaching for the fire poker. Arthur sighs. “Not like that. With your magic.” Merlin looks at him over his shoulder. “Are you…” “ Y es, Merlin, I’m quite sure. Just stoke the bloody fire, would you?” There’s that same quiet laugh, then, and Arthur’s hand clenches around his cup as he feels the sound send a wave of pure warmth right through him. “Pushy,” Merlin mutters, but reaches out a hand anyway. “ Baern,” he whispers, although Arthur imagines that the spoken spell is just for show, since he’d lit that one in the forest without muttering a single thing. The fire surges in height and warmth, burning bright and casting a yellow-orange glow across the chamber walls. The sight of it, of seeing Merlin bring the element of fire under his command so easily, makes Arthur feel strange. There’s wonder. Admiration, perhaps. And, if Arthur’s being completely honest with himself, a bit of fear. He has spent most of his life being taught that sorcery is pure evil, after all, of witnessing witches and warlocks wreak havoc on his kingdom, on the people he loves. And, deep, deep down, there’s something else, too. Something that makes his blood thrum, that makes his palms warm and his breath come quicker. Down, down, down. He takes another gulp of wine. “Thank you, Merlin,” he says, and feels a rush of relief when the words come out sounding normal, rather than choked. Merlin stands up and goes to sit in the second chair, set strategically across from Arthur, rather than next to, as they usually do. He wants to see Merlin’s face as he talks. Wants to see the truth in his eyes, instead of just hearing it from his mouth. “I want you to tell me everything,” he says, because there’s no point in beating around the bush. They both know why Merlin is here. Merlin doesn’t answer right away, and Arthur looks up at him. His manservant has both hands around his cup, one palm clenched around its center and the other held above its rim, one finger tracing the circle thoughtfully. And Arthur just stares and stares and wonders how many times those hands have been used to save his life. How many times Merlin has lifted them in defiance, eyes flashing ‒ Gold. He realizes that ever since Merlin revealed himself as a sorcerer, all the magic he’s done has been performed while turned away from him. Arthur has dealt with enough sorcerers to know that their eyes alight when using their magic, and out of nowhere he is struck with the urgent want ‒ no, the need ‒ to see Merlin’s blue eyes flash with gold. He shoves the urge away, trying not to dwell on why he’s having it in the first place, even while his traitor heart whispers you know damn well why. Merlin finally answers. “That might take a while.” Arthur shrugs. “We have all night.” “I’m not sure that’s enough time, to be honest,” Merlin says, and though his mouth turns up in amusement, his eyes, flickering in the firelight, look entirely serious. In that moment, Arthur realizes that Merlin’s service to him, his loyalty, goes far beyond what he’s imagining. It’s written into Merlin’s very body, into the way he holds himself as he gazes into the fire. There’s a tiredness there. A wisdom born from years of keeping secrets and sacrificing, of hiding and fearing for his life. Arthur takes a deep breath. Merlin’s eyes flick over to meet his, and that same breath catches in his throat. He exhales. Says, “I need to hear it. I need to hear it all, Merlin. No more lies.” Merlin nods in acceptance. “Okay,” he says, and finally takes a drink of his own wine. Then, he sets the cup on the floor ‒ Arthur supposes he’ll need a clear head to get all the details right ‒ looks up at him, and, to Arthur’s surprise, a smile alights his lips. “It all began the day I came to Camelot,” he says, “and came face to face with a royal prat.” Something in Arthur’s chest eases. He smiles back. It’s a very long story. He begins with the witch, Mary Collins, who’d impersonated Lady Helen in her attempt to assassinate Arthur. This is a story he knows well. What he hadn’t known, however, was that Merlin had slowed the dagger by using magic. A flicker of anger alights in him and he hisses, “You used magic in front of my father ?” He shakes his head. “Christ, Merlin. Sometimes I think you really do have a death wish.” “Only when it comes to you, Arthur,” he says, so casually, and Arthur asks Merlin to move on with the story because he can’t ‒ won’t ‒ think of the implications of those words, teasing as they may be. He learns that Merlin is the one who sent the light to guide him while Arthur was out looking for the mortaeus flower, learns that Merlin is the one who made the sword that Arthur pulled from the stone those four years ago. His eye twitches as he listens to this particular part of the tale. “So you did make that story up.” He sighs. “I thought it was horseshit, but then I actually pulled the sword out, and…” He trails off. His eyes snap up to Merlin’s. “That was magic. I didn’t do anything!” Merlin shrugs, but has the decency to look sheepish. “Arthur, you should have seen yourself. You were so lost, so confused, I…” When his eyes meet Arthur’s, there’s this softness to them that, quite irritatingly, saps almost all the anger out of him. “...I just wanted to help you.” Arthur decides to let it go, nodding curtly, but only because Merlin is looking damn near wounded in the face of Arthur’s anger, and he’s so tired of Merlin being sad. He’s been wearing the same expression for the past year, that look of weariness and melancholy, and a part of Arthur, however buried, really just wants to see that cheeky smile he’s grown used to. The anger returns, however, when Merlin tells the truth of the incident with the Questing Beast. He stands up, nearly empty wine cup clenched in his hand so hard his knuckles turn white, and the chair screeches on the stone floor as it skids. “Merlin, you fucking idiot. ” There are a million different words floating around in his head ‒ many of them furious, many of them strangely scared ‒ but he finally settles on, “It is not your job to sacrifice yourself for me. You are my servant, Merlin, a member of my household, and it’s my duty to protect you! Not let you toss your life away as if…” As if it means nothing. As if Merlin dying wouldn’t have ripped a hole right through the center of his chest, even then. He imagines what Merlin must’ve looked like, approaching Nimue. Imagines Merlin as he was back then ‒ nineteen years-old, a boy, ready to give his life for a prince who had done nothing to earn such unwavering loyalty. The image makes him ill, and he slowly sits back down in his chair, feeling faint. Unsure if it’s the wine or the heaviness of the truth causing him to feel so off-kilter, he decides to set his own cup on the floor. He has to face this head-on, he realizes. Using drink as a buffer for the pain is cowardice. “I had to,” Merlin says softly. “You were ‒ are ‒ my destiny, Arthur. I couldn’t let you die, not when I knew there was something I could do to stop it.” And there’s that word again. Destiny. He wonders how many times it will come up tonight, and asks himself the question that’s been bubbling under the surface of his mind for days, now. Is destiny all it is? The tale stretches on and on, filled with more stories of danger and sacrifice, and, of course, magic. Arthur feels in turn scared, angry, and, in many cases, completely filled with awe. He also feels guilt. Shame. That much isn’t new. Merlin tells him of Balinor ‒ Balinor, who had been Merlin’s father ‒ and Arthur recalls the moment after the dragonlord’s death, when Merlin had cried and Arthur had later told him, “ No man is worth your tears.&quot; As if sensing Arthur’s turmoil, Merlin pauses in his story, watching as Arthur imitates his pose from earlier that evening, sinking down to put his head between his hands. Waves of guilt wash over him, hitting him ruthlessly, cold as a winter sea crashing against a rocky shore. “He was your father,” Arthur says, and it’s a mere whisper. “Your father, and I ‒ I didn’t ‒ I just ‒ ” He doesn’t even know how to express the pure pain he feels on his friend’s behalf, how to tell him how deeply sorry he is. But he tries. Lifting his head up, he says, “I should’ve been there for you, Merlin. Your father died, and I didn’t even know. I couldn’t help you.” He meets Merlin’s eyes, sees the quiet pain on his manservant’s face. It’s an old grief, Arthur knows, but he also knows what it means to lose a father. Those wounds never truly heal. Arthur’s whole body suddenly goes cold. For the second time in days, he thinks of that morning after his father’s death, when Merlin had been waiting for him outside the doors. For him. For him. To be next to Arthur in his grief, even if it meant spending the night on a cold stone floor. And what had Arthur done when Balinor died? He’d cursed. He’d been furious at the loss of Camelot’s last chance against the dragon. He’d hardly spared a thought for Merlin. “It’s not your fault, Arthur,” Merlin says. “You didn’t know.” Because I didn’t tell you. And Arthur should feel angry about that. He doesn’t. He just feels sad. Sad and so very ashamed. More stories. More secrets revealed. It’s hours in, now, and the night has settled into a heavy darkness. Arthur feels tired, and not just because of the late hour. With each word that comes out of Merlin’s mouth, he’s thrust deeper and deeper into the throes of guilt. There are moments of reprieve, like when Merlin tells the truth story of the goblin, but it’s mostly tale upon tale of pain that Merlin has experienced out of his strange, completely baffling imperative to protect Arthur at all costs. It’s when he’s retold the story of the sword in the stone that the blasted word comes up again. Arthur finally cracks. “Can you please explain why you keep saying that?” he snaps, interrupting Merlin’s feeble explanations for why he deceived Arthur with his little story about the sword. Merlin frowns. “Saying what?” “ D estiny. You said it when I was dying, and you keep saying it now.” Unbidden, the memory, as they have been all damn week, hits him out of nowhere. Merlin, sitting down next to Arthur. “One more day,” he pleads. Arthur. Staring off into the quiet forest, feeling Merlin slip his arm through his own, feeling the cool, tender press of a cloth against his cheeks, his forehead. He asks the question that’s been burning him up, that’s been on the tip of his tongue since Merlin first created a fucking dragon out of fire, since Arthur’s entire worldview got flipped on its head. “Why did you never tell me?” “I wanted to, but…” “What?” The word comes out sounding almost delicate. If it were any other situation, Arthur might berate himself for showing such blatant vulnerability. But he’s dying, and he’s sad and confused and his best friend of ten years is a sorcerer. If there’s any time where wallowing and insecurity is justified, it’s now. Merlin’s lips quirk up. “You would’ve chopped my head off.” And Arthur knows instantly that he wouldn’t have, he wouldn’t have ‒ but he’s also not sure what exactly he would have done, and says as much. “And I didn’t want to put you into that position.” And that’s when it clicks. He turns to meet Merlin’s eyes for the first time since they started talking, and there’s something there that is so full, so warm, and Arthur can’t look away. “That’s what worried you?” he asks, because, really? Out of all the things that Merlin must’ve feared ‒ banishment, pain, execution ‒ the thing he feared most was putting Arthur in a bad spot? In forcing him to...what? Make a tough choice? He wants to say that, wants to exclaim: “I’m the bloody king, Merlin, I make tough choices all damn day long,” but he’s just silent because Merlin is still looking at him with those eyes, as if Arthur is the very sun in the sky. “Some men are born to plow fields. Others live to be great physicians. Others...to be great kings.” Merlin’s gaze locks on Arthur’s. His heart beats fast and hard in his chest. “I was born to serve you, Arthur. I’m proud of that. And I wouldn’t change a thing.” And that’s the moment Arthur knows. When he realizes what’s hiding beneath the loyalty and devotion in Merlin’s eyes. But even then, he can’t bring himself to fully acknowledge it. It slots right into place ‒ the true final puzzle piece ‒ but he only lets the thought live for a moment for desperately scrambling to extinguish it. Merlin asks, “Ready?” and Arthur nods, and they move on. Now, he looks up at Merlin. Locks eyes with him. For a moment, there is naught but silence between them ‒ perhaps the longest stretch since Merlin began his story. Finally, Merlin asks, “Do you know what the dragon told me when I first came to Camelot?” Arthur’s gut twists with anger at the mention of Kilgharrah, but he keeps his temper in check, shaking his head. “I went to him, maybe a week or so after I started working for you.” Merlin gives the smallest of smirks. “I was complaining about you.” “Shocking,” Arthur says dryly. “At least that much hasn’t changed.” Merlin’s smile widens for a moment, before fading into something softer. “He told me, a half cannot truly hate that which makes it whole. ” The words make Arthur’s breath catch. His hands start to tingle and he shifts in his chair, feeling oddly hot all over. Maybe Merlin ought to lessen the fire a little, he thinks, and casts his gaze to the floor because there’s no way in hell he’s looking his manservant in the eye right now. A half cannot truly hate that which makes it whole. And really ‒ Arthur has gotten quite good at this “pushing down feelings” thing, but the implications of that sentence are exceedingly difficult to ignore. Merlin plows on. “The first time we ever met, he told me that you and I shared a destiny. One that’s been prophesied for centuries, apparently. He said that you were the Once and Future King, meant to unite Albion and bring magic back to the land. And he told me that I was meant to help you. That it was my ‒ ” “ ‒ destiny,” Arthur finishes, because of course. It all makes sense, now. Merlin’s excessive need to protect him, to ensure Arthur’s safety no matter the cost. It’s never been about him. It’s about this prophecy. About his destiny. He’s feeling something strange, this odd mix of vague relief and something cold and dark, crushing and sad, when Merlin says ‒ “I think I messed it up, though. Towards the end.” Arthur frowns. “What do you mean?” Merlin gives a deep, heavy sigh, a sound that’s so burdened, so melancholy, that it makes Arthur’s chest ache. “That comes in later.” Merlin tells him about Mordred, next, and suddenly Merlin’s uncharacteristic coldness towards the Druid boy ‒ something Arthur spent the better part of a year trying to decipher ‒ makes sense. “I couldn’t figure out why you were acting so strangely,” Arthur mutters, rubbing his forehead. Even now, Merlin’s eyes burn with something akin to hatred, and the sight of it gives Arthur the shivers. Because surely that’s not Merlin? Right? Merlin is sweetness and kindness. He’s endlessly compassionate and always seeks out the best parts of people, often to his own detriment. The darkness born of hate looks so wrong on him because Merlin has always been so full of light. But Arthur would be naive to ignore the quiet melancholy that has clouded his manservant’s aura for the past year or so, or to think that the bright young man who stumbled ‒ and saved ‒ his way into Arthur’s service a decade ago hasn’t changed. Of course he has. All of them have changed. Yet the thought of Merlin losing that innocence, that sheer goodness that has been a guiding light in Arthur’s darkest times, is worse. He looks up into Merlin’s eyes ‒ flinty in the firelight ‒ and thinks that he’d do just about anything to keep him from growing any colder. “He’s dead now, Merlin,” Arthur says softly. “It’s over.” Merlin sucks in a deep breath. Shakes his head. His fingers are clenching, pressing into his palms and out, again and again. He looks away from Arthur, towards the fire, and Arthur knows, instinctively, what he’s about to say. “I should’ve killed him.” The words are quiet, but hard as stone. A chill sweeps over Arthur. “No, Merlin. He hadn’t done anything wrong. You did the right ‒ ” Now it’s Merlin’s turn to be furious. He stands up, pushes his chair away and goes to stand in front of the fireplace. His hands are clenched in fists at his sides. “He almost killed you, Arthur!” He flips around suddenly, facing Arthur, and his face is painted with a fury that he’s never seen on his manservant’s face before. In an instant, though, it shifts to something mournful. Merlin’s voice cracks when he says, “You almost died, and I…” he trails off, putting his head in his hands. And then it’s like all the strength, all the anger, suddenly leaks out of him, leaving only sadness in its wake. He sinks down in his chair, hands still covering his face. Arthur wishes he knew what to do. He wishes he knew how to comfort his friend, how to make it all better. Seeing Merlin upset has always twisted his heart, but now, knowing that it’s the thought of Arthur’s death that makes him so grief-ridden, the twist is accompanied by guilt. Merlin’s hands fall from his face, and when he looks up at Arthur, his eyes are red-rimmed. “I don’t know what I would’ve done.” The words are only a whisper, yet so terribly loud in the otherwise silent room. “If you died. I don’t...I…” He shakes his head minutely. “I think a part of me would’ve just...died with you.” A half cannot hate that which makes it whole. The words echo in Arthur’s mind. He knows exactly what Merlin means. He thinks back to that time, four years ago, when Merlin ‒ stupidly loyal, brave Merlin ‒ threw himself in the path of the doracha to save Arthur. He remembers the sheer panic he’d felt in that moment, and the relief that had flooded through him when he’d watched Merlin breath once more. And he remembers watching Merlin ride away on the back of that horse, remembers barely holding back tears, because God forbid his men see the grief that was burning all through him, choking him. He remembers thinking: I cannot lose him. All these years, Arthur has been trying to shove that knowledge away ‒ that Merlin is essential. That Arthur, despite all that he says, needs him, as much as he needs food and water and air. That losing Merlin would be like losing a limb, like losing his own beating heart. Because if he admitted that ‒ if he was honest with himself about Merlin’s importance in his life ‒ where did that leave them? What did it mean? What did it say about their relationship ‒ about their feelings? The feeling that had washed over him that first night in Camelot surges up within him, all- encompassing and awful, bright and brutal, as he looks into Merlin’s stricken eyes. It crashes into him, wave after wave, and he breathes in deep. Shuts his eyes and looks away because he can’t do this, he can’t. Push it down, down, down, he tells himself, but Merlin is sitting right in front of him, so open and vulnerable, and Arthur can’t just pretend that this conversation isn’t happening, that Merlin hasn’t just admitted that Arthur’s death would, more or less, destroy him. That Arthur hasn’t, on some level, known the same all along. “Arthur?” Merlin asks, so quietly. So softly. But it’s also a question, perhaps, asking him: do you feel it, too? Overwhelmed, Arthur stands up, moving to the fireplace and putting his hands on the mantle. He sucks in deep, long breaths, trying to do so quietly, so that Merlin can’t surmise the turmoil that’s turning his insides into a whirlwind. He can’t think about this right now. Not with Merlin right there, watching him. He’s afraid that if he turns ‒ if he lets their eyes catch ‒ then Merlin will be able to see it there, on his face. He’ll know. And Arthur cannot let him know because this cannot happen. He digs his fingers into the stone of the mantle, lets the pain flood his senses. A few moments pass, and eventually the feeling begins to recede, until he finally feels calm enough to turn and sit back down in his chair. He meets Merlin’s eyes. He’s sitting back in his chair, hands playing with the hem of his shirt, but his gaze is locked on Arthur’s. His eyebrows are pulled together in concern. “Are you okay?” Arthur nods sharply. “I’m fine, Merlin.” He tears his eyes away, looks to the crackling fire instead. It’s died down quite a bit over the past hour or so, so Arthur swallows thickly and asks, “Could you…?” he waves his hand in the direction of the fireplace. Merlin’s expression brightens at the request, and he nods, sitting up and holding out a hand. He repeats the same word from earlier ‒ baern ‒ and although he really shouldn’t, although he ought to keep his eyes on the fire and watch the magic itself, Arthur instead watches Merlin. It’s only for a moment, but it’s there ‒ the shift of cerulean blue to pure gold. The sight makes Arthur’s heart pound in his ears, makes warmth flush all through him, and the feeling only gets stronger when Merlin lowers his hand and meets Arthur’s eyes. Arthur ought to look away. But he doesn’t. For once in his life, he lets himself drink in the sight of the man before him. His closest, dearest friend, with his dark hair and strong, high cheekbones and deep blue eyes that look right into his with the same exact intensity, with the same focus and curiosity and ‒ No. Arthur looks away. He always does, eventually. It’s when Merlin tells him of the incident with the Dsir that his words from earlier ‒ I think I messed it up, though. Towards the end ‒ make sense. He’s recounting the story rather quickly, as if he wants to get it over with and move onto another tale. As if there’s something he’s hiding, and damn it, Arthur is tired of the secrets. “And then you asked me what I thought about it, and I told you, and you went back to the Dsir with your decision ‒ ” The realization slaps Arthur in the face. “So...what should we do? Accept magic or let Mordred die?” Across the fire, Merlin is uncharacteristically quiet. But it’s more than that, Arthur thinks. His manservant looks genuinely conflicted. Upset, even. He sucks in a deep breath, gaze flickering back and forth along the ground, but never meeting Arthur’s. It’s only after a very long moment of consideration that Merlin finally looks up. That he finally gives Arthur his answer. “There can be no place for magic in Camelot.” “Merlin,” he cuts in. His manservant stops mid-sentence, and Arthur sees something not unlike panic flit across his face. “Yes?” Arthur leans forward in his chair, staring at Merlin in open, blatant shock. “You have magic, Merlin ‒ the strongest magic out there, apparently ‒ and yet you told me that there was no place for magic in Camelot?” Arthur shakes his head, mind buzzing with this new realization and what it means. “You were willing to let an innocent man die. Why?&quot; Merlin sighs in frustration. “Arthur, I told you ‒ Mordred was destined to kill you! What was I supposed to do? Say yes and let the prophecy come true?” “Yes, Merlin! Yes. You would’ve finally been free. You wouldn’t have had to keep your secret anymore.” From me are the unspoken words that hang in the air. “I mean ‒ isn’t that the whole point of the prophecy? You and me, working together to unite Albion and bring magic back to the land?” To this, it seems Merlin has no reply. Or, rather, no reply that he’s comfortable voicing aloud. He seems to curl in on himself, somehow, eyes flicking away from Arthur to some space over his shoulder. “Merlin?” Arthur presses. “Stop, Arthur. Just…” Merlin shakes his head. “I don’t want...I don’t…” “What?” When the words come, they’re loud enough to shake the castle walls themselves. “I don’t want to admit that I messed everything up! ” I think I messed it up, though. Towards the end. Is this what Merlin was talking about? Merlin is staring into the fireplace, hands clenched on the arms of his chair. Arthur rises from his seat, slowly. He walks over to where Merlin sits, places a hand on his manservant’s shoulder and squeezes. Merlin doesn’t look away from the fireplace, but he bites his lip and Arthur notes that he’s trembling. “Merlin,” he says quietly. “It’s okay. You know you can tell me anything. I won’t judge you.” The quiet air buzzes with tension. Arthur watches shadows flicker across the angles of Merlin’s face, watches as he finally draws himself up a little and looks towards Arthur, expression twisted with something that looks a lot like shame. “You’re right,” he says softly. “About the prophecy.” Sensing that Merlin is about to talk for a while, Arthur gives his shoulder one last squeeze and returns to his chair. He waits patiently for Merlin to continue, and after a long moment, he does. “When I first came to Camelot, and Kilgarrah told me about my destiny, I was...confused. Unsure. It didn’t make sense. But I trusted him.” Merlin gives a bitter laugh. “Of course I did. I’d spent my whole life with this incredible gift, but I lived in Ealdor, where there was little I could do with it. And then I found myself in Camelot, and here was this incredible creature ‒ this magical creature, magic like me ‒ telling me that I had some destiny. “It hardly mattered that my destiny involved you, because suddenly I had a purpose, you know? I had proof that my magic wasn’t just for tricks, for felling trees and helping crops grow back home. I was meant to do something more. And that was exciting. It felt good. Sure, you were a prat, and arrogant, and a bit of a bully.” He pauses to give Arthur a wry smile, and he can’t even find it within himself to protest, because he really had been pretty awful when he was younger, hadn’t he? “But you were noble, too. Honorable. Brave.” Arthur flushes a little at that. He hadn’t realized Merlin had thought that of him, back then. “And eventually…” Merlin trails off, and his fond smile fades away, a shadow falling over his face. “What?” Arthur asks, so very softly, because he has a feeling that Merlin is about to say something important, and he has no intention of letting him wriggle his way out of the truth yet again. “Eventually, it stopped being about...that.” At Arthur’s questioning eyebrow, Merlin adds quietly, “Destiny, that is.” Silence. Then ‒ “What do you mean?” Merlin looks away from Arthur, fixing his gaze on the stone floor instead. His hands, folded in his lap, twist together, and Arthur realizes with no small amount of surprise that Merlin is blushing. “I’m not sure exactly when,&quot; Merlin goes on. “But at some point, I started to care less about destiny, about uniting Albion and bringing back magic, and more about…” he trails off, but then he gives Arthur a meaningful look and he suddenly knows. “Oh.” It’s hardly the most eloquent thing he’s said, but Arthur is too shocked to respond with anything coherent. Merlin, who has spent ten years hiding his magic, something so integral to his very being, had been willing to give up all his hopes and dreams of being free to be himself. Why? For him. For Arthur. Merlin’s destiny, their destiny. He’d been willing to chuck it out the door, to throw it all away, in an attempt to prevent a future that might not have even occurred. All to keep Arthur safe. And although the guilt is back in full force, although there’s anger there, too (because how dare Merlin do that, how dare he sacrifice so much for Arthur’s sake? As if Arthur wouldn’t do anything to make Merlin happy, especially after this long year of seeing his once cheerful eyes turn cold and morose), Arthur can’t deny the feeling of pure warmth that floods him. It’s sickening, isn’t it? He should be ashamed. And he is ‒ of course he is ‒ but he can’t help but feel so terribly happy to know that Merlin cares so much for him, that he’d be willing to do anything to keep him safe. It makes him feel protected. Safe. Loved. The word causes a jolt of something ‒ hot, blazing, impossible something ‒ to shoot through him, and Arthur has to stand up, walking over to the window to let out the energy that’s buzzing all through him. He stares out at the streets of the citadel below him, watches the moonlight glitter on the stone, and feels complete and utter relief. Because Arthur feels the same, doesn’t he? He always has, even if he’s tried to deny it, both aloud and in his own head. He’d move heaven and hell to protect Merlin, to keep him from any sort of harm. He’s always known that Merlin was unflinchingly loyal, that he’d always be by Arthur’s side come what may, but to know that his feelings of protectiveness are reciprocated so fully, so intensely ‒ it does something strange to him. Makes his chest clench and his stomach twist, makes his blood go hot. He wonders: is this normal? To feel so strongly about someone? To be willing to do anything ‒ and Arthur means anything ‒ to keep someone safe? What he and Merlin feel for each other...gods, what does it even mean? A part of him whispers ‒ you know exactly what it means. But Arthur can’t face that. Not fully. Not now. He goes to sit back down. Merlin is watching him, expression almost fearful. Arthur hates that ‒ hates it when Merlin is frightened of him. Oh, there are moments of teasing and banter between them, moments when Arthur likes to rile him up and make him a little paranoid or wary. He especially likes those times when he gets right up in Merlin’s personal space after giving a vague, teasing threat of some sort, and Merlin gets all flustered, the tips of his ears turning red and his eyes darting here and there. But genuine fear? No. Arthur doesn’t want that. Especially now that he knows that Merlin must’ve been afraid of him all along, at least on some level, due to his secret. He wants to eliminate that fear, wants to destroy any wisps of terror that may linger in his mind. Arthur wants Merlin to know that he’s safe with him, no matter what. A part of him wants to grip Merlin’s forearms, get in his face and tell him, “You could do anything, Merlin, anything, and I’d care for you anyways,” because it’s completely, irrevocably, terrifyingly true. “I’m sorry,” Merlin says, suddenly, pulling Arthur from his thoughts. Arthur sighs deeply. “Whatever for? I swear, Merlin, if you keep apologizing…” “ ‒ I shouldn’t have lost my way,” Merlin interrupts, and he looks so wrecked, so upset, that Arthur can’t bring himself to admonish him. “I should’ve kept to the path, should’ve done what destiny asked of me. I was just so...frightened. Of losing you.” He looks up at Arthur, who can only hold the gaze a moment before he has to tear his eyes away from the vulnerability he sees there. “It’s okay, Merlin,” he says. “I understand.” Indeed he does. All too well. Finally, deep into the darkest hours of the night, the story comes to an end. Merlin tells the full truth of what happened while Arthur was at Camlann, and then they’re sitting together in absolute quiet. The fire has died down yet again, but Arthur refrains from asking Merlin to stoke it. He doesn’t want to face that feeling again, the one that arises within him when Merlin calls his powers forth and his eyes flash gold. “I’m not sure what to say,” Arthur murmurs into the quiet, and it’s true. Both thank you and I’m sorry have already been uttered a thousand times, it seems, and are entirely inadequate anyways. And although Arthur has loved fiercely, although he has felt that sense of words not being enough ‒ when seeing his father’s eyes glow with approval as he was crowned Prince of Camelot, when clasping Guinevere’s hands the day he took her as his queen ‒ he has never felt it to such an extreme. “It’s alright,” Merlin says. He looks up at Arthur, then, his eyes so kind and sweet in the low light, and fuck, Arthur doesn’t deserve him, could live a thousand lifetimes and not deserve to be looked at like that. “You don’t have to say anything. It’s...a lot to take in.” “That’s an understatement,” Arthur says, dryly but without much humor. Indeed, nothing about this situation ‒ this moment ‒ is even remotely funny. Gods, he wishes it was. He wishes they could just slip right back into their old routine, into the jokes and the banter. He wishes he could just leave it like this, simply not say anything like Merlin is suggesting. They could go their separate ways for the night and let the truth simmer under the cover of the deep dark. This could be the end of the story, Arthur realizes. The truth is out, is laid bare for both of them to look at, to consider and muse over. They could go on as they had before ‒ Merlin by Arthur’s side. A steadfast presence. A treasured friend. The only difference would be the lack of secrets between them. But Arthur can’t. He looks at Merlin, who’s now turned his gaze to the fire, a soft smile alighting his lips, and knows that it’s impossible to simply go back to the way they were before. Too much has changed. Too much has been revealed. The words ring in Arthur’s head yet again: Just, just...just hold me. Please. He flushes from just the memory. As it happens, Merlin chooses this moment to look back to him. Seeing Arthur’s blush, he quirks an eyebrow, something unreadable flickering across his face. “You alright?” Arthur shakes his head, running a hand through his hair. “I’m fine,” he says, but the words come out sounding hoarse. And then something strange happens. This feeling hits him all at once, and it’s like all the breath has been sucked right out of him, and he realizes that there is in fact something he could say. Words that could do justice to Merlin’s story, to the truth, and what it all means. Three of them, to be precise. Arthur’s feeling very warm, now. He realizes, with a good amount of embarrassment, that among the emotions assaulting him right now, one very prominent one is fear. He’s realized what he has to do ‒ what he has to say ‒ if he is to be truly honest with Merlin, and he’s fucking terrified. Somehow, he gets up the nerve to say, very quietly, “I was thinking.” And gods, now would be a great time for Merlin to give his usual line ‒ try not to hurt yourself, sire ‒ but his manservant is far too clever for his own good and somehow knows that what Arthur is about to say is important, so he simply asks, “About?” He sounds curious, but not fearful. It occurs to Arthur that, for once, Merlin is the oblivious one. He doesn’t know what Arthur is about to tell him, doesn’t realize that everything is about to change. Arthur clears his throat. He feels off-kilter and a bit fuzzy. His heart beats hard and loud in his ears, and he takes a deep breath to calm himself, but it’s really no use. No amount of mental preparation is going to make this any easier. “About when I was dying,” he says, and although he’s looking at the stone floor of his chambers, he notices Merlin sitting up slightly from the corner of his eye. “When I…” Arthur trails off, and gods, how is ever going to get the words out if he can’t even say this? He takes another breath, shifting in his chair because he needs to move, needs some sort of conduit for the energy, however small. “When we were close to the lake. Before I passed out. When I asked you to…” Hold me. Arthur doesn’t say it, but something in him compels him to look up, to meet Merlin’s gaze. He sees the realization dawn and he knows now that Merlin is putting the pieces together. Arthur watches as Merlin’s eyes widen slightly, as his face changes, paling a little with shock. And Arthur really doesn’t have time to analyze that; he has to keep talking or he’ll never be able to say it. He looks away again, to the fire, as Merlin says, “I remember.” A simple response. Arthur recognizes it as an invitation to keep talking. He forges onwards. “I just...need you to know that when I said that, I ‒ I just ‒ I really did want you to, I...I meant it, I…” he trails off again, shaking his head, because he’s not making any sense. None of it is coming out right, but then, that might have to do with the fact that Arthur is so fucking scared. Arthur has looked death in the eye, more than once. He has faced the wrath of his father’s judgement, has fought creatures of unimaginable power. He has knelt for the ghosts of druids, allowing himself to be at their mercies, has watched Camelot burn and crumble under Morgana’s cruelty. He has allowed himself to be vulnerable, has been open about his feelings, his love, with Gwen. Yet none of that could ever compare to the fear he feels right now, in this very moment. Arthur feels hot and cold at the same time. His heart beats so fast and loud in his ears that it nearly drowns out the sound of the crackling fire. “Merlin, you are ‒ you’re important to me,” Arthur says, still looking away. And damn, even that’s not right, because Merlin already knows that. “And when we were travelling to the lake together, I realized just how much, and I ‒ ” he breaks off, voice simply failing him. “ Fuck, ” he whispers. “It’s okay, Arthur,” Merlin says, and Arthur supposes the words are meant to comfort him ‒ to help him through whatever he’s trying to say ‒ but Merlin’s voice is too shaky, too quiet, and Arthur knows that Merlin is feeling just as conflicted, just as torn up and hopeful and terrified as him. “I was dying,” Arthur says, and his voice sounds scratchy and far off, “and you were there, and I wanted so badly to tell you, but I didn’t know how. I didn’t know how, and gods, I don’t even think I really knew. Not until we got back here, and now I keep thinking about it, over and over again, I can’t stop thinking about it. About what I said, about what you said. And you’re still here, still by my side, and I don’t know why because I don’t deserve it, Merlin.” He shakes his head, eyes still on the flames but not really seeing them. “And I keep seeing you, and you’re just ‒ all I can think about, and I just need you to know that I ‒ ” He breaks off abruptly, still unable to really say it, to get the words out. He looks up. And it’s the visage of Merlin sitting before him, expression written in shades of surprise and apprehension and hope, that does him in, finally. It’s like that first night back in Camelot, then. It’s as though his body ‒ his very soul ‒ is being assaulted with it. It crashes over him, again and again and again, and the words keep ringing in his mind, begging to be let out, but surely he can’t? That’s the first time he’s ever phrased it like a question, he realizes. And this is the moment where Arthur Pendragon understands. Understands that he’s fucked, that it’s over. That it’s been over since Merlin brought him back from the brink by the Lake of Avalon. Perhaps before that, even. Was it when Merlin pressed his hand to Arthur’s cheek and whispered, “ Get some sleep ?” Was it moments before, when Arthur, inhibitions weakened by his dying heart, let his eyes linger on Merlin’s lips and said, “ I don’t want you to change. I want you to always...be you.” Was it even earlier? Perhaps when Arthur let all his fear, all his worry and concern, shine through in the caves, three years ago? “I came back because you’re the only friend I have and I couldn’t bear to lose you. ” Or, maybe, when Arthur came out of the throne room to see Merlin sitting there on the floor, exhausted and sad yet awake. Awake because of Arthur, because Merlin hadn’t wanted him to feel alone. It doesn’t really matter, Arthur supposes. All he knows is that he can’t keep it inside any longer. Not after years of denial, of pushing it down, down, down, of pretending that what he feels for Merlin is anything less than earth-shattering. Visceral and existential and desperate. There’s the sense of wetness on his cheeks, and Arthur realizes, with no small amount of humiliation, that he’s begun to cry. The tears are silent, traitorous, slithering down his face without warning, but they’re undeniably there. He reaches up to wipe them away, but it’s fucking useless, because they just keep coming and coming and suddenly Arthur is breathing even harder, his heartbeat hammering even faster, somehow, in his chest. He tells himself, over and over again, to pull it together, but he can’t. He can’t. Distantly, in the back of his mind, Arthur notes that he hasn’t wept since his father passed away and wonders what Merlin must be thinking right now. The feeling is relentless in its pursuit of him. Ruthless. He just sits, puts a hand to his forehead, shaking his head as the tears fall. He breathes in a harsh, gasping breath, and is filled with shame at being so horribly weak. He’s a king. He can’t fall apart like this. But the dam has broken, now. And there’s no stopping the flood. He looks up at Merlin, who gazes at him in open concern. He’s sitting up in his chair, as if he’s half ready to get up and walk over to Arthur, to comfort him. But Merlin knows him better than anyone on this earth, somehow knows that right now, in this moment, Arthur needs space. The words are wrenched up from somewhere deep, deep inside him. From places he’s never let himself acknowledge, let alone look into. It’s a broken admittance, one born of years of longing, of wanting without even realizing it, of desire buried beneath layers and layers of it can never be. And it can’t. But he says it anyways. “I love you.” Arthur’s voice breaks as he says it, cracks on the word love, and he sees Merlin’s eyes widen, sees the pure, unadulterated shock that spreads across his face, before he has to look away. Terror washes over him. He trembles. He reaches up, wiping the tears from his cheeks, feeling completely raw. It’s as though he’s been cut right open, as if he’s ripped his heart from his chest and is holding it out to Merlin on his palm. Because that is what he’s doing, isn’t it? Laying himself completely bare for the first time. Acknowledging something he’s known subconsciously for years, something he’s kept hidden under the insults and the mocking and the playful banter. And it’s so damn transparent, now, that all the shut up, Merlin’s and you really are an idiot, aren’t you, Merlin?’s were born of a desperation to keep all that longing locked away, deep where no one could see it. Not even himself. But now he’s seeing it ‒ really seeing it ‒ and it’s blindingly obvious that when Arthur lay on the edge of the treeline, dying, and told Merlin thank you, he was really saying I love you. Overwhelmed, Arthur lets out a shaky breath and puts his face in his hands, the tears only slowing due to the fear that’s beginning to overcome him once more. Fear of Merlin’s reaction, because damn it, he still hasn’t said anything. The room is completely silent, save for the fire and Arthur’s heavy breathing. He finally gathers enough courage to let his hands fall, to look up once more. To meet Merlin’s eyes. Merlin, who is staring at him with this look of sadness and wonder and ‒ Love. And although Arthur already knew, somewhere deep down, that Merlin felt the same way, that there was no other explanation for his manservant’s complete and utter devotion to him, looking it in the face is another thing entirely. Arthur sucks in a breath, shifting in his seat, feeling dizzy. He can’t tear his eyes away from Merlin’s, couldn’t even if he wanted to. It’s as if there’s a magnetic pull between them, urging him forwards, and before Arthur realizes what he’s doing, he’s standing up, and so is Merlin, and within a few seconds they’re a mere foot away from each other. “ Arthur,&quot; Merlin breathes. The way he says it ‒ laced with sheer reverence and desire ‒ makes a full-body shiver run down Arthur’s spine. The firelight flickers on the planes of Merlin’s face, casting him in a golden glow, and Arthur can almost imagine the magic that runs through his veins thrumming beneath his skin, luminous and powerful and alive. Arthur stands there and looks and oh gods, he wants. He lets his eyes drift to Merlin’s lips and linger there, hears Merlin’s sharp, quiet intake of breath. Merlin’s own eyes drop a fraction of an inch before locking back onto Arthur’s, and he’s hit with such a wave of longing that it nearly makes his knees go weak. He imagines shoving Merlin back against the stone wall of his chambers, imagines how Merlin might gasp at the force of it, at the pressure and intensity. He imagines dipping his head down, on pressing his lips to the pulse point on Merlin’s neck and feeling the fluttering of his heart. He wonders if it’s beating as hard and fast as Arthur’s, wonders what Merlin would do if he dragged his lips from his throat to the hollow of his collarbone and bit. Arthur is flushed and shaky and still thinking about the way Merlin breathed his name, and every part of him wants to reach out, to grab Merlin by the hips, or wrap a hand around the back of his neck, and pull him closer. And it’s crazy. It’s impossible. This is Merlin. His manservant. His best friend of ten years. His sorcerer, his hidden protector. And a man. Arthur is flooded with shame, with confusion, because men aren’t supposed to desire other men. Arthur isn’t meant to long for the feel of a man’s body pressed against his own; it simply isn’t done. There may not be any laws against it, but there are most certainly rules. Unspoken, maybe, but known by all. There was a man, once. When Arthur was eighteen. He’d just been made the head of the knights, was high on the excitement of leadership and honor, when a scandal occurred among his men. Sir Bran, a knight who’d been of an age with Arthur, was discovered coupling with a stable boy by another knight ‒ Sir Kay, to be exact. Kay had promptly gone to Arthur, where he’d been sitting in his chamber by the fire, enjoying a brief moment of relaxation after a particularly vicious day of training. Arthur recalls the look of disgust on Kay’s face as he’d relayed the news, the way he’d said the words with a lip curled in distaste. As for himself? Arthur had been less disgusted and more...confused. As if it had simply never occurred to him, the idea that men might want to lie with other men. He’d merely sat there for a moment, nursing his cup of wine, taking in the news and trying to wrap his head around it. And when he’d realized that Kay was waiting for some sort of order ‒ What do you plan to do, sire? he’d asked ‒ Arthur, hit with this strange feeling, as if he’d missed the last step of a staircase, had risen from his chair and said, “I’ll speak to my father about this. Thank you, Sir Kay.” Back then, it had been Arthur’s most natural instinct to seek his father’s counsel in moments of uncertainty. Yet when it came to this particular incident, it seemed that Uther was perplexed as to why Arthur had come to ask for advice. Eyebrows narrowed, the king had simply told him, “It’s really quite simple, Arthur. Come up with a decent excuse to get rid of him.” Arthur’s eyes had widened, a wave of shock jolting through him, as the first thought that came to mind was ‒ what does he mean by get rid of him? Surely he wasn’t saying… Uther must’ve been following Arthur’s train of thought, as he’d rolled with eyes and said, “Gods, Arthur, I don’t mean kill him. Just revoke his knighthood and send him away. I trust you can come up with a believable justification.” He’d made a face, then ‒ a combination of both disgust and pity. “It’s a bit of a shame, admittedly. Sir Bran is a talented swordsman, and an otherwise honorable man. But someone with such preferences cannot be allowed a knighthood, of course.” Of course. Said so casually, as if Arthur ought to know already. But he hadn’t, and now, as he stood there listening to Uther, he was flooded with a strange, unfamiliar feeling. His body had gone hot, his muscles going tense. He’d thanked his father for the counsel and exited the king’s chambers in a hurry. On his way to Sir Bran’s rooms, it occurred to him that the feeling felt dangerously close to shame. But that didn’t make sense. Arthur had nothing to be ashamed of. This situation, Lord Bran’s preferences, as Uther had put it, had nothing to do with him. So why did he feel so off-kilter? So unbalanced? Unsettled, Arthur had shoved the feeling down ‒ down, down, down ‒ and went to do his duty. He never saw Sir Bran again. Now, standing before Merlin, close enough to reach out and touch ‒ and gods, does Arthur want to touch ‒ he is flushed with that same feeling from years ago. And only now does he understand why he’d been so conflicted and off-put by the incident with Sir Bran. Because Arthur has wanted in the same way as his former knight. He’d always waved it off as admiration of strength and talent, of prowess, but he’s nevertheless held a certain appreciation for other men since he was young. He’d felt it when he’d faced down Lancelot for the first time, and when he’d met Percival and even Gwaine. He recalls the way his eyes would sometimes linger on them during training, admiring, recalls the way he always assumed it was completely normal, that other men must do the same. He’d never recognized it as anything more than an intense sort of appreciation, had never considered it could ever be attraction. But it was. It is. Arthur is sure of that, because as Merlin stands before him now, eyes burning with the same want that’s coiling in Arthur’s gut, he wants nothing more than to know him in every way one can know a person. He wants to feel it, feel the heat, the pressure and intensity of skin against skin, wants to map every inch of Merlin’s body with his burning palms. He wants to know how he would sound, how he would look if Arthur were to him make him ‒ Arthur breaks off that line of thought immediately, because that’s too much, too dangerous. Because if Arthur starts thinking about that ‒ imagining that ‒ he’ll never be able to go back. “ Merlin, ” Arthur says, and is too caught up in the tension to care about how sheer desire is turning his words into broken things. He reaches out a hand, and Merlin steps closer, eyes fixed on Arthur’s lips, and then ‒ Arthur steps back, letting his hand fall. Merlin freezes. The moment stretches out into what feels like eternity. They simply stare at each other, both aching to be closer but unable to move towards what they want. Merlin looks at him, broken, and says what they’re both thinking. “ We can’t. &quot; And there it is. Two words that have defined their relationship for years, probably, even if Arthur was unaware of it. But then ‒ was he, really? Unaware? In that instant, Arthur knows that it isn’t true. He’s always known, on some level. He simply never let himself look at it. Never let himself even think about it. But he knew. Deep down, somewhere hidden very far within him, he knew. And he also knows why he chose to keep it there, why he has spent years pretending and ignoring and covering up his feelings with insults and jokes and banter. We can’t, Merlin had said. The thought that Arthur had just before his confession ‒ gods, Arthur still can’t believe he said it ‒ comes back to him. It can never be. And Arthur’s heart just cracks, right down the middle, because he knows it’s true. He’d give anything for it not to be, but then ‒ Arthur’s never had a particularly easy time when it comes to love, has he? He thinks of Gwen, then ‒ of the obstacles of their courtship, of the forbidden nature of their love ‒ and almost has to laugh, because wow, Arthur really is quite talented at making his life more difficult than it needs to be. Falling in love with a servant is one thing. Falling in love with a male servant is another thing entirely. The former could be accepted ‒ was accepted ‒ by the people of Camelot. In fact, Arthur thinks that over the past three years, the citizens of his kingdom have grown to appreciate that their queen was once a commoner, that Arthur doesn’t see rank in the same way that other nobles do. The latter, on the other hand? It’s unthinkable. Men don’t court other men, and women don’t court other women. It just doesn’t happen. Hell, it’s probably barely done in secret, much less out in the open, for fear of judgement and retribution from those who are particularly close-minded. And that isn’t even considering the fact that Arthur is the King of Camelot and needs an heir if the Pendragon dynasty is to continue. And, above all, the fact that Arthur is married. Images of Guinevere ‒ of his beautiful, compassionate, incredible wife ‒ flood his mind, and Arthur is hit with a wave of intense guilt. He moves further back, away from Merlin, shaking his head. “Gwen,” he chokes out, and Merlin must understand, because he nods. “I know,” he says, sounding just as hoarse. Just as broken and lost. “I know, Arthur. It’s alright. It’s fine, it’s…” he trails off, looking away. Arthur sees him swallow and his eyes fix on the long line of Merlin’s throat, hidden beneath his neckerchief. Arthur is struck with the urge to march over to him, pull it away and press his lips, his teeth to the pale skin there, and ‒ Guinevere. Arthur sucks in a breath. We can’t. “I have to go,” Arthur says, even though it’s his chambers, not Merlin’s, and it’s only a couple hours until dawn. Merlin is still looking away from him, breathing hard, and Arthur sees him nod before he turns on his heel and walks over to the door, heart still hammering in his chest. He opens the door, walks out, and closes it. He makes it to the other end of the hall, to a window tucked into a nearby alcove, and presses his palms up against the glass. He takes deep, long breaths. Closes his eyes. Finally, he pulls away. Legs still feeling strangely numb, he makes his way to the training yard, still in his nightclothes, and bashes at a dummy with his sword until dawn casts its first tendrils of light over the grass. He focuses on the sweat and the ache of his muscles, on the grip of Excalibur’s hilt in his palm, and thinks of nothing and everything all at once. This will be my last confession “I love you” never felt like any blessing Whispering like it’s a secret Only to condemn the one who hears it A week passes. Naturally, neither Arthur nor Merlin mention the incident. To say that things are tense between them would be an understatement, and the two men take to avoiding each other at all costs. Merlin brings Arthur’s breakfast early in the mornings, before Arthur’s awake. He dresses on his own. Merlin stays away from the training field and is even missing from the round table meetings. There are multiple times where Arthur looks to his right, expecting Merlin to be there, before remembering. It’s like a slap across the face each time, made even worse when he turns back and sees Gwen sitting at his left. It replays over and over in his head, a tortuous, perpetual loop. He finds himself drifting off in the midst of important discussions about policy, thinking of the way Merlin had breathed his name. He’ll be having dinner with Gwen in their shared chambers, listening to his queen chat about her ventures into the lower town, and suddenly find himself recalling the way Merlin had looked at him after Arthur’s confession, the pure, unadulterated love written into the lines of his face. Each and every time, Arthur finds himself feeling hot all over, has to drag his thoughts to something else before he gets noticeably worked up. And each and every time, he thinks to himself: is this how it will always be? The time he spends with Merlin is even worse, somehow. For years, Merlin has been the one person Arthur has felt completely relaxed around, the person with whom he is utterly comfortable. His kingly airs, the stress and pressure of his duties ‒ when he’s around Merlin, he’s always been able to let it all fall away. And although he is much the same with Guinevere, there are certain things ‒ certain worries and troubles ‒ that he’s never been able to share with her. Not out of lack of love or trust, but out of fear that she’d find him lacking. That she would be disappointed. Because Guinevere knows him well. Very well. He trusts her with his life, with his kingdom. But there’s only one person who Arthur trusts completely, with every piece of his soul, even after everything. Even after the magic. Yet being around Merlin has ceased to be comforting. Now, the two flit around each other awkwardly, avoiding eye contact and conversation and touch. There are a few times when they slip up. Merlin’s hand will accidentally touch his while he’s serving Arthur wine, or their sleeves may brush when Merlin moves past him, out of Arthur’s chambers. Each time it happens, Arthur feels as though his entire body is being lit up, and the heat that passes swiftly through him leaves him flushed, heart beating fast. He knows Merlin feels it, too ‒ can tell by the almost startled look that arises on his face before he quickly crushes it, turning it into something more neutral. Worst of all, however, is when they catch eyes. There’s something about the way Merlin looks at him ‒ the intensity he finds in the dark blue of Merlin’s eyes ‒ that makes Arthur feel as though he’s suffocating. He’ll be relaxing in his chambers, sitting by the fire, and Merlin will come in to tidy up before heading back to his own room. And Arthur will look up, despite himself, and the two will meet eyes and it’s like that evening all over again. Arthur’s breath catches and his heart damn near stops, and it happens every fucking time. It might be bearable if the tension lessened with each stolen glance, but gods, it somehow gets worse. Arthur looks at Merlin, and Merlin looks at him, and all Arthur can think is I love you and I want to touch you and it’s made all the worse by the fact that Merlin is clearly thinking the same thing. And sometimes Arthur curses himself, wishes that he’d never said anything. He lets himself imagine what things would be like if he’d kept this final secret to himself. Merlin would still be where he’s supposed to be ‒ glued to Arthur’s side at all times. He’d joke and laugh and give Arthur that wonderful, ridiculous grin, and Arthur would return it with a smile of his own and they’d be good. They would be happy. But it would be a lie. And after ten years of such a heavy secret between them, Arthur is done with lies. Arthur thinks about how it’s said that the truth sets you free, and how he’s found that this truth has instead created a prison. Arthur loves Guinevere. He loves her very, very much, to the point of sometimes being knocked flat by it. There are times when his queen will be laying on their bed, hair loose around her, smile soft and sweet, and Arthur gets an intense warmth in his chest and feels as though he’s the luckiest man in Camelot. And Gwen knows him, knows when he’s upset or conflicted, when he’s angry or annoyed. So it’s no surprise at all that by the end of the second week since the incident with Merlin, she asks him to join her in her personal chambers for a talk. It’s evening, and Arthur is tired. Tired from meetings and still-healing wounds, and tired from constant thoughts of Merlin and Merlin’s eyes and his lips and, above all, the way he says Arthur’s name, and ‒ “Arthur?” He looks up, startled, and flushes deeply when he sees Gwen, sitting next to him at her table, giving him a concerned look. “Yes?” Arthur says, and almost winces because his voice still sounds so far-away, so detached from the present moment. “Sorry. I was…” he trails off. It’s not like he can tell her the truth. The irony of that is like a sudden punch to the gut. When it comes to lying to the people they care about, it seems that he and Merlin have traded places. Waves of guilt wash over him, and he has to remind himself that this is why he and Merlin made their decision. If a confession is enough to make Arthur feel like this ‒ as though he’s burning alive with shame ‒ he can hardly imagine how he would feel if he and Merlin were to ‒ Push it down, down, down. Gwen is still looking at him with open concern, her brown eyes soft. “Are you alright, Arthur? These past few weeks, you’ve been acting...odd. I’m worried about you.” Arthur’s blood turns cold, and he fights to keep his expression neutral. Surely she doesn’t know? Mind whirling, he thinks back to the moments he’s shared with his wife recently, the conversations and walks and meals, trying to figure out if he’s done something to give it all away. He pushes down the panic, though, because Gwen’s sitting right there and he can’t give her even a hint, not anything, or it’ll all be over. Instead, he gives her his best smile and says, “I’m quite alright, Gwen. Just stressed, I suppose. I’m still a bit tired, too, I think. From the wound.” That’s only half true; he is still feeling a bit under the weather due to his injury, but not so much that it’s debilitating. Gwen’s expression goes tight with worry ‒ although Arthur notes something else, too. Not quite like suspicion, but close. As if she knows that Arthur isn’t telling the whole truth. How could she not tell? They’ve been married for three years, in love for even longer. Gwen has always been good at picking out his lies, and the increased desperation behind telling those lies isn’t going to change that. It may, in fact, make Arthur’s falsehoods all the more obvious. The thought makes his body tighten with nervousness. Nonetheless, Gwen reaches out to place a comforting hand on his. “I didn’t know it was still bothering you. Have you talked to Gaius?” Arthur nods before he even realizes he’s doing it, and a second later it occurs to him that that’s another lie. He hasn’t spoken to Gaius in days, has been avoiding his chambers, in fact, out of fear that Merlin might be hanging around. That thought brings shame in and of itself. It seems that admitting his feelings has turned Arthur into a coward. Gwen squeezes his hand. “Good,” she says. “I’m sure you’ll be feeling better soon.” She pauses, biting her lip. It’s clear that there’s more she wants to say, and Arthur sighs, smiling fondly despite the tension of the moment. Even now, years later, his wife is still sometimes reluctant to speak completely freely around him. Arthur might be hurt if he didn’t know that it was more the result of many years of habit than a lack of trust. “What is it, Gwen?” he asks, raising an eyebrow. “You can tell me anything. You know that.” Even as he says it, though, a part of him fears her words. Fears that somehow, she knows. “I just…” she sighs deeply, running a thumb over Arthur’s palm before meeting his eyes. “I noticed that you and Merlin seem to be avoiding each other. Did something happen between you two?” All it takes is the mention of Merlin’s name and Arthur’s entire body goes tight with immediate tension. His heartbeat quickens, and it takes every ounce of Arthur’s control over his emotions to keep his expression calm. “Arthur?” Gwen questions, and he realizes that he’s yet to answer her. His face goes hot; he prays that it doesn’t flush, that it doesn’t give him away. “No,” he answers, and inwardly curses himself when the word comes out sounding short and bitten-off. “No, of course not. We’re fine. We’ve just been busy.” A shadow crosses Gwen’s face, and he knows that she knows he’s lying. The shame hits him full force once more. He wonders: is this how Merlin felt? Every time Arthur mentioned magic, each time he proclaimed sorcery to be pure evil. And gods, what about the time he’d been accused of magic by the Witchfinder? How had he felt, standing in front of the court, his secret laid bare for all to hear? He’d denied it, of course, and it had all turned out fine, but surely he must’ve been terrified? Arthur thinks, rather bitterly, that he’s beginning to understand Merlin’s fear better than he’d ever thought he would. “Are you sure?” Gwen asks. “I wondered if, perhaps...well, I wondered if Merlin’s magic is still bothering you? That he kept it secret, I mean?” For a moment, Arthur can only stare at her, so intense is his relief. That’s what Gwen thinks is wrong? Arthur feels as though a stone has been lifted from his chest, feels the tension drain from his body. Of course, she’s not entirely wrong. Arthur is still a bit upset about the magic, and it’s not as though Merlin’s deception isn’t important context for the real issue. Arthur imagines it will take him a while before he’s completely worked through that. But that’s nothing ‒ absolutely nothing ‒ compared to what’s actually been haunting his thoughts these past few weeks. Arthur smiles, and this time, it’s real. “Guinevere, I solemnly promise you: I am not angry at Merlin for keeping his magic secret.” He pauses. “Well, maybe a little. But not nearly as much as I was. We’ve talked about it a lot, and we’ll get through it.” He squeezes her hand, watching as relief washes over Gwen’s face, a lovely smile alighting her lips. Arthur grins, murmurs, “That’s better,” and leans over to kiss her gently. When he pulls back, however, Gwen’s easy expression shifts into something a bit more strained. Arthur frowns. “You’re still upset.” Gwen sighs. “I’m glad that you’re not cross with Merlin for keeping his magic secret. But, Arthur ‒ I’m not blind. There is something going on with you two. Merlin hasn’t been to any of the round table meetings in nearly two weeks, nor has he been on the training fields.” When Arthur opens his mouth ‒ to what, protest? How could he, when she’s right about all of this? ‒ Gwen says quickly, “I’m not angry, Arthur, I’m just worried. I know you and Merlin are close and I’m so very glad for it.” She smiles at him, so lovingly, and the pangs of guilt are back, alongside the fear. “Merlin has always been good for you, and you for him, even if you’re loath to admit it.” The look she gives him then is almost admonishing, and if Arthur weren’t so completely paralyzed with anxiety, he might’ve blushed in response to the gentle reproach. “I just hate to see either you or Merlin upset,” she finishes. “And you are upset, Arthur. Don’t try to deny it.” She raises a brow, lip curling in a gentle smile. “I know you far too well.” It’s true, however much Arthur wishes it weren’t in this moment. And Gwen is still looking at him expectantly, waiting for him to answer, and the panic is back as Arthur racks his mind for some sort of excuse. To his horror, he finds none. Gwen sits there and waits, and the longer she waits the more worried she becomes, her wry smile turning to a concerned frown. Arthur thinks and thinks, trying to come up with something believable, but gods, she’s too good at this, at knowing when he’s lying. No matter what he says, she’ll know it’s not true. And now he’s thinking about the actual truth, damn it, his mind flashing back to that evening two weeks ago for what must be the hundredth time that day, and he’s sure that he’s flushing now, sure that she must know ‒ “Arthur?” Gwen asks. He looks over to her, trying desperately to calm his racing heart, trying his best to appear calm. She looks almost nervous, now, her eyebrows pulled together, mouth slightly open. “What is it? You look as if you’ve seen a ghost.” She gives him a smile, but it’s a bit uncertain. “Whatever it is, I’m sure it’s nothing you two can’t work out. You always do.” Arthur opens his mouth to say something ‒ but, of course, nothing comes out. Because Arthur has no idea what to say. How to lie to his wife. Arthur has never been a liar. Has never really needed to be. It’s in this moment that the door to Gwen’s chambers opens, the sudden sound making Arthur jump in his seat. “Gwen? I was hoping to talk to you about ‒ ” It’s Merlin ‒ of course it is, Arthur thinks, because his luck is clearly being tried today ‒ standing in the doorway. His mouth opens in surprise and his eyes flick briefly to Gwen before settling on Arthur. And it’s just like every time before, only worse, because now Guinevere is a witness. Merlin immediately tenses, and a part of Arthur wants to shout at him, wants to say damn you, Merlin, surely you’ve gotten good at this over the years? But Arthur is no better, of course. And this is an entirely different sort of secret, with entirely different consequences. Arthur looks at Merlin and his words from that night hit him again, no weaker despite the time that has passed. “I love you.” and ‒ “Gwen.” Arthur feels sick to his stomach, but somehow wrenches up a smile, because Gwen can’t know, she can’t. He looks at Merlin and prays that he can read that in Arthur’s eyes. “Merlin!” Arthur proclaims, just as he has a thousand times before. “To what do we owe the displeasure?” There’s a moment where Arthur is afraid that Merlin can’t do it, that he can’t pull it off, where he looks at Arthur with that same intensity, that same tension. And then, a moment later, Merlin smiles, and Arthur is struck dumb because wow, it looks almost the same as it always has. “Sorry to disappoint, sire,” he says, “but I was actually hoping to speak to Gwen, if it’s not a bother?” It takes a moment for Arthur to respond ‒ he’s still shocked by how wrong his thought from earlier was, because apparently Merlin can lie, and fucking well ‒ but then he’s nodding and saying, “Of course,” and getting up from the table, relief coursing through him at the escape that Merlin’s just given him. He gives Gwen a final smile, puts everything he has into making it look convincing. “I’ll see you later, Guinevere,” he says. Gwen’s returning smile is still a bit tight, and Arthur tries not to think about what that means as he all but flees her chambers, walking briskly out the door. For the first time in a long while, Arthur finds himself at the tavern. He probably shouldn’t be surprised that his troubles have led him here. Although he’s made a point to avoid drinking in public ever since he was old enough to get a taste for alcohol ‒ and especially since he became king ‒ there are times when damn it, he just needs to get away, to find some sense of comfort. And since neither of the two people he usually turns to are an option, it seems he’ll be searching for it at the bottom of a cup. Arthur’s not stupid enough to let himself get drunk, of course. Rather, he finds himself a table, tucked into the back corner of the establishment, and nurses a single ale as the night falls dark and heavy that evening. He looks at the window, watching as the gentle patter of rain begins. He lets himself drown in the sound of it, in the look of the water as it gathers on the cobblestone streets, the puddles glinting in the brightening moonlight. It’s nice. Soothing, even. Naturally, this is the exact moment that Merlin walks in. He doesn’t have to say anything; he doesn’t need to. Arthur is looking out the window when he gets this feeling ‒ this prickling on the back of his neck ‒ and then he’s turning his head to the door, instinctively, and there’s Merlin, showing up unexpectedly for the second time that day. Arthur watches as he peels off his brown jacket, that ratty thing he’s been wearing since the day he walked up to Arthur ten years ago, hand held out, a friendly smile on his lips, and said, “ I’m Merlin. ” Now, as Arthur sits here across the room, watching as Merlin sweeps a hand across his forehead to wipe away water droplets and walks up the counter to order a drink, he finds himself wishing, rather bitterly, that Merlin had just kept to himself that day. That he’d let Arthur be, that he’d never challenged him to a duel in the middle of the lower town, so overconfident and stupid and cheeky, that he’d never waltzed into Arthur’s life with that smile and those adoring eyes and made himself a nice little home right in the middle of Arthur’s heart. Because now it’s too late, and Merlin is too much a part of him, and Arthur knows that if he were to ever leave, he’d take half of Arthur’s very being ‒ his very soul ‒ with him. We can’t keep going like this, Arthur thinks to himself, eyes still glued to his manservant as he takes a seat across the way. His table is on the other side of the tavern, facing the door, and he hasn’t noticed Arthur’s presence. If they do, it’ll tear them apart. Arthur knows it, knows it in his very bones. Merlin takes a sip of his ale, and Arthur feels heat curl in his gut as he watches Merlin’s lips press to the rim of his cup. They have to talk about it. And they have to do it now, or they might never talk about it at all. And Arthur can’t bear that, can’t imagine living the rest of his life like this, both of them avoiding each other, so gutted by an impossible longing that it rips their bond to pieces. Arthur needs him. Even if he can’t have Merlin in the way he wants, he still needs him by his side. He realizes, with a not insignificant amount of embarrassment, of shame, that when it comes to Merlin, he’ll take whatever he can get. Gripping his cup of ale in one hand, Arthur rises from his table and walks over to Merlin’s, heart beating faster and faster as he gets closer. Merlin’s head must be somewhere else tonight, as he doesn’t notice Arthur’s approach until the very last moment. He’s tracing the rim of his cup with one finger, lips in a firm line, expression unreadable. It’s only when Arthur is standing right before him, hands shaking a little, that he looks up. His eyes widen in momentary surprise, but a moment later, something else ‒ something a lot like acceptance, as if Merlin has, on some level, been anticipating this moment ‒ slides into place. “Arthur,” he says. Smiles softly. Arthur doesn’t ask ‒ just takes the opposite seat, doing his best to ignore the way his palms are sweating and his throat is turning dry. And it’s so stupid, he thinks, that he’s still feeling this way, two weeks after that evening. But there’s just something in the way Merlin looks at him, even now, that makes Arthur want to hide. That makes him want to do the opposite of hide, whatever that may be. Merlin takes another sip of his ale, leaning back in his chair and fixing Arthur with an expression that is equal parts nervous and resigned. As if he already knows where this conversation is going to go. “We can’t keep this up, Arthur,” Merlin says, voice low. “Gwen’s noticed that something’s off, and no offense, but you’re pretty shit at lying.” Arthur can’t help it; a white-hot feeling of bitterness rushes through him, momentarily blinding all the other emotions that Arthur’s been struggling with over the past few weeks. “Unlike you,” he bites out, accusatory. He gives Merlin a cold smile. “No wonder you managed to keep your secret for ten years. I thought that perhaps I was just blind, but no ‒ you’re just an excellent liar.” He gives a humorless laugh and lifts his cup to his lips. Takes a big gulp. “It’s almost impressive.” Merlin is silent, and when Arthur looks up, the hurt on his face is unmistakable. Arthur feels an immediate pang of guilt, followed by frustration, because surely some bitterness is justified? Surely he’s allowed to be at least a bit angry? “Stop looking at me like that,” Arthur says, low and angry and a little bit cruel. “Like what?” Merlin asks, and there’s anger in his voice, too, and that just pisses Arthur off even more. “Like I’m the one who’s being unfair,” he snaps. Merlin’s voice is ice when he says, “I thought you understood why I lied.” It takes all of Arthur’s willpower not to slam a fist onto the table. Instead, he opts for curling his fingers around it, digging his nails into the wood. “I understand, Merlin,” he bites out. “That doesn’t mean I’m not allowed to feel…” Feel what? Hurt? Betrayed? Angry? He feels them all, and all at once. But beneath all of that, simmering steadily, powerfully, is something stronger. Something that compels him to meet Merlin’s eyes once more, that curls itself around the invisible thread that connects them, that stretches taught when their gazes catch. Merlin sighs, reaching up with a hand to rub between his eyes. “I know,” he murmurs. “I’m so ‒ ” “Stop,” Arthur says. “I told you: no more apologies. We’re done with that, okay? It’s just going to take some time to get used to. I’m still going over it all, in my head. Everything you told me. Everything I ‒ ” Arthur breaks off, eyes leaving Merlin to rest on a spot over his shoulder. Everything I told you. It’s too much, Arthur thinks. Merlin’s magic. Merlin’s lies. Merlin’s devotion and loyalty and his love. Your love, whispers a voice in the back of his head. Merlin’s secrets were enough to handle on their own, and now Arthur’s gone and fucked it all up, has somehow made it worse. It occurs to Arthur that what he said to Guinevere earlier that day may have been his only believable lie, due to the fact that Arthur hadn’t even known it to be one ‒ that is, that he’s no longer upset with Merlin about his magic. Because it’s clear now that he is. It’s also clear that it nonetheless pales in comparison to the other reason they’re both sitting here, having this conversation. Even now, Arthur feels the anger draining away, replaced by something hot, something burning, as Merlin meets his eyes once more. His manservant reaches up, runs a hand through his dark hair before resting his elbows on the table, threading his fingers together, gaze on Arthur the whole time. He lets out a shaky exhale, and Arthur’s own breath catches at the sound. “Arthur,” he remembers, and grips his fingers even tighter around the table, and suddenly all he can think about is the way Merlin looked at him that night, the way his eyes darkened as Arthur moved closer to him. His eyes dip to Merlin’s neck. For once, his manservant has gone out without a neckerchief, perhaps dressing in a more relaxed fashion due to his destination. He remembers his thoughts from that night, his fantasies of dipping his head down, of pressing his lips to the pale skin of Merlin’s throat, and flushes hard. The alcohol buzzing through his system certainly isn’t helping, and fuck, why did Arthur think this was a good idea? Right. They’re meant to be having a conversation about why this is a terrible idea. About how they can get back to normal. But as Arthur sits here, eyes catching on the two spots of red that have arisen high on Merlin’s cheekbones ‒ from the ale or something else, Arthur isn’t sure ‒ he thinks that maybe there is no getting back to normal. The thought makes panic bubble up inside him, because he cannot lose Merlin. He can’t let this ruin them, or Arthur will never, ever forgive himself. “I can’t lie to Gwen,” he finally says. He uncurls his hand from around the table, brings it to his forehead. Runs it through his hair. “She’ll know. She always knows.” Merlin’s mouth quirks up at that, just slightly. “That’s Gwen for you,” he says fondly. “She’s smarter than the both of us combined, I’d say.” “Not that that’s horribly difficult,” Arthur mutters, not really able to care that he’s just insulted himself along with Merlin when his manservant gives a soft laugh. It’s the first time he’s heard it in weeks, and the sound only deepens Arthur’s longing, bringing about a sort of bittersweet hurt. “True,” Merlin says, taking another drink. He turns his head, then, to look out the window. Arthur is struck by the sheer beauty of his profile, of the angles of his cheekbones and the dark fan of his lashes. Merlin has always been beautiful, in a striking, fey sort of way. Arthur thinks he’s probably known that since the moment he first lay eyes on him outside the citadel, thinks he probably shoved it down, along with a thousand other difficult, impossible feelings. He doesn’t say it, of course ‒ Arthur is now highly aware of the consequences of speaking such things aloud ‒ but he’s sure that it’s written all over his face, because when Merlin looks back to him, his blue eyes turn soft and sweet, and the loveliest of smiles alights his lips. Arthur aches. It’s like this intense pressure in his chest, like a drawn out pain that’s ever-present, always lurking, poised and ready to strike at all times. And then, out of nowhere ‒ so simply, so casually ‒ Merlin looks him in the eye and says, “I love you, too.” Arthur freezes, his whole body going tense. And even though he already knew that, even though it was evident in the way Merlin reacted to his own confession, in the things he told Arthur while explaining the whole truth of the past decade, the words still make him feel dizzy. His breath comes faster and he just sits there and stares, unable to really process it. The smile Merlin gives him is so very sad. “Just wanted to make sure you knew,” he says, and there’s something so delicate about the way he says it. And Arthur wonders if that’s true. If Merlin only wanted to make sure ‒ or if, perhaps, he felt compelled to say it, just as Arthur had been. As if the words were a living, breathing creature inside him, begging to be let out after years and years of being trapped. “I knew,” Arthur says. The words sound almost foreign to his ears, as if he’s saying them without actually hearing them. He adds, quietly, “I think I always knew, maybe.” Merlin nods, eyes fixed on his cup. After a moment, he responds, “I didn’t know. About ‒ ” He clears his throat, and Arthur watches a blush rise on his cheeks. “About how you felt. I mean, I always hoped, but I never really imagined ‒ ” He breaks off, shaking his head, and now he’s really turning red. And damn it, Arthur can’t help it; he smiles fondly, unable to keep the affection out of his voice when he mutters, “You really are an idiot, Merlin.” It’s the closest thing they’ve had to a normal MerlinandArthur exchange in weeks. Even before that fateful evening, in the short period where Arthur was up and about after recuperating from his injury, they’d acted differently around each other. Not necessarily awkwardly. Things had just been...tense. And now that same tension has been ramped up to an extreme, so Arthur lets himself enjoy this brief moment of reprieve, where they share fond insults and warm looks and it doesn’t need to mean anything more. But it does, of course, and Merlin’s gaze melts into something so loving that Arthur feels his heart seize up. “We need to figure out how to make this work,” Arthur says. Normally, he’d be averse to having this conversation in public ‒ in a tavern, of all places ‒ but it’s so busy and loud in here, and Arthur and Merlin are tucked far enough away that there’s virtually no risk of being overheard. And, if Arthur is being completely honest with himself, the idea of having this talk in Arthur’s chambers ‒ the same spot where they’d been that evening ‒ is far more dangerous. Because there’s a bolt on Arthur’s door, and a bed in the corner of the room, and Arthur is smart enough not to tempt himself like that. He tells himself, over and over again, that he’d never do it, that he wouldn’t betray Gwen like that. He wouldn’t. But then he looks over to Merlin, sees those fucking eyes, and knows that he can’t risk it. Because he’s a king, and an honorable man, but he’s also human. And so ‒ despite all his powerful magic ‒ is Merlin. Merlin nods. “I know,” he says. “It’s just…” he trails off, giving Arthur that damn look again, and Arthur lets out an almost frustrated sigh. “Stop that,” he snaps, and squeezes his eyes shut, rubbing his brow. He hears, rather than sees, Merlin’s quirked eyebrow. “Stop what?” “You know what. That... thing you do.” He opens his eyes, feels heat arise on his cheeks. “With your eyes.” Now it’s Merlin’s turn to blush, and Arthur wonders if he even realized he was doing it. “Sorry,” he mutters. And it’s so pathetic, so very sad, that Arthur finds himself wanting to laugh at the sheer stupidity of it all. At the sheer hopelessness of this situation. Gods, all Merlin has to do is look at him and Arthur just ‒ He shakes his head, sighing very deeply. How the hell did he keep this all locked up so tight? How did he manage to deny it all these years? Because now that’s finally letting himself look at it, letting himself feel, it’s impossible to stop thinking about it. “What did I say about apologies?” Arthur asks, though it’s not really a question. “It’s not your fault, Merlin. It’s mine. If anyone should be sorry, it’s me.” He lifts his cup, takes a long drink of ale, and then frowns when he realizes he’s getting close to the bottom. “I’m the one who brought it up.” It. As if it’s just some simple, casual thing, and not the most powerful fucking feeling Arthur has ever known. “It’s not your fault either, Arthur,” Merlin says. “It’s not anyone’s fault. It just...is what it is, I suppose. People shouldn’t have to apologize for the way they feel.” Arthur shrugs. “Most people aren’t the King of Camelot.” The King of Camelot who is married, in fact. And a man. Gods. Arthur still isn’t sure how to work through that, isn’t sure he ever really will. Except Merlin, is, apparently, because the next thing out of his mouth is, “I didn’t even know that you felt that way about…” he trails off, somehow blushing even deeper. “You know. Men.” The last word is very quiet, and Merlin casts his eyes around the tavern, as if making sure no one has heard. But the place is just as rowdy and crowded as ever, and no one seems to be even looking their way. They used to, back in the day, when Arthur first started coming here with his knights. But they’ve since grown used to it, to an extent, and outside of a few formal greetings and bows, as well as a few handshakes and polite smiles, Arthur ‒ and whatever companions he brings along ‒ is usually left alone. Arthur shifts in his seat, uncomfortable with the turn that their conversation has taken. Which is a bit silly, he supposes, since being in love with Merlin blatantly implies Arthur’s capacity to be attracted to men. Yet hearing the words spoken aloud brings up that deep, long-felt shame that’s made a home in his gut, and Arthur turns his eyes away, keeping them fixed on the table. “I…” he begins, and coughs, feeling strangely hot and off balanced. “I didn’t even realize it, I don’t think, until…” His eyes flick up to Merlin, and he watches as realization dawns on his manservant’s face, watches as his expression shifts into something shy and surprised and… Smug? Arthur’s eyes narrow. “Don’t look so pleased,” he mutters. But he can’t help the pool of warmth that gathers in his stomach when Merlin, both flustered and perhaps a bit proud, grins. “I didn’t say anything,” Merlin protests weakly. “You didn’t have to.” There’s a moment of silence between them, then. Not quite comfortable, maybe, but it’s filled with a certain amount of sweetness that has been lacking from their interactions lately, and Arthur basks in it for a moment, relishing in the the sound of the rain against the window pane and the feeling of warmth from the ale. A thought occurs to Arthur, then, and he turns to Merlin with a raised eyebrow. “What about you?” he asks. “What?” “How long have you known?” The words come out sounding almost shy, and Arthur’s heart beats wildly, a part of him still unable to believe that they’re having this conversation. Merlin blushes and shrugs. “A while.” “That’s not very specific.” When Merlin doesn’t answer, Arthur probes, “Come on, I was honest with you. Now it’s your turn.” He gives Merlin a small smile. “No more secrets, remember?” Merlin snorts. “You’re going to milk the magic thing for the rest of my life, aren’t you?” he asks, sounding more amused than annoyed. Arthur grins. “Did you expect anything less?” “Of course not,” Merlin responds, shaking his head. Then, he lets out a sigh and leans back in his chair, expression turning thoughtful. “I’ve known since...pretty much forever, I guess.” Arthur’s eyes widen. “Really?” Merlin nods, still wearing that far-off look. Arthur watches as the shadow of sadness crosses his face. “There have been a few people over the years. There was Freya ‒ ” A wave of pure guilt washes over Arthur, and he has to remind himself that he didn’t know, that there was no way he could’ve known that the bastet had been a woman whom Merlin loved. “ ‒ but there were a few men, too.” Merlin says it so very casually, and Arthur is struck by how comfortable he seems with the idea. When Arthur says his next words, they’re quiet and heavy on his tongue. “You don’t think it’s...wrong?” Merlin’s eyes flash to his, and Arthur is slightly taken aback to see them alight with a flicker of anger. “No. Do you?” The words are a challenge, Arthur realizes. He decides to answer as honestly as he can, because it’s just like he said: no more secrets. “I don’t think so. But…” He trails off, and Arthur watches as Merlin’s expression softens, seemingly catching onto Arthur’s internal struggle. “...I’ve always been told that it is. That it’s not natural, that men who do that are dishonorable. That they’re…” “Corrupted?” Merlin supplies, quietly. Arthur flinches. Nods. “Yes.” Merlin nods, too, as if he’s received an answer to some sort of question. He takes another sip of ale, and Arthur goes to do so as well, only to find that his cup has finally run dry. Damn. It’s probably for the best, anyways. His head is starting to get a little too fuzzy ‒ although that may have more to do with the nature of their conversation. “People say the same thing about magic, don’t they?” Merlin asks, pinning Arthur with thoughtful eyes. The intensity in his gaze makes Arthur feel warm all over. “I suppose they do.” “And now you know that’s not true. That all magic isn’t evil, that just because an opinion is widely-held doesn’t mean it’s right. ” Merlin’s words are hard and intense, born from emotion deeply felt, and Arthur can’t look away from him, can’t bring himself to disagree, because now that Merlin is saying it, it seems obvious that he’s right. That what they’re both feeling ‒ it’s not wrong. How could it be? How could something so powerful, so deep and visceral and real, be wrong? And Arthur looks at Merlin, at the assurance and devotion and love in his eyes, and knows that he’s thinking the very same thing. Arthur is at a loss for words, is unable to dredge up anything that even remotely matches the whirlwind of emotion inside him, so he merely nods and looks Merlin in the eye and hopes that what he feels shines through. And judging by the almost proud gleam in Merlin’s eyes, it does. Although it’s easy to talk about their feelings in abstract terms ‒ to make the conversation about relationships between men in a more general sense ‒ that’s not the reason they’re sitting here right now, and they both know it. The conversation lulls, and the tension picks back up as Arthur watches Merlin drain the rest of the ale from his cup, watches him wipe his mouth with the back of his hand. He licks his lips absentmindedly, catches the bottom one in his teeth, and Arthur’s heartbeat quickens. “Arthur?” Merlin asks, and he immediately tears his eyes away, meeting Merlin’s stare and flushing hard when he realizes that he’s been caught looking. He almost apologizes before remembering his own words. No more apologies. There&#x27;s a long moment of tense silence, something hot, something electric, crackling in the air between them. Just being around Merlin ‒ being in his mere presence ‒ is enough to make Arthur feel overwhelmed. And judging by the way Merlin keeps stealing glances at him, keeps shifting in his chair, eyes dark and cheeks flushed, he feels much the same. It’s one thing to long for someone without knowing the truth of their feelings. But now everything’s out there, laid bare. The secrets have been revealed, and they’re left with nothing to do but attempt to repair the damage. Because Arthur loves Merlin, and Merlin loves Arthur. But nothing ‒ nothing ‒ can ever happen between them. Arthur stares into the bottom of his cup, clenches his hands into fists, and tries to push down the feeling of queasiness that arises at that final thought. There’s nothing to be done, Arthur tells himself, breathing in deeply. Yet every instinct is telling him no, telling him of course there is. He looks up quickly, hoping to sneak a glance at Merlin, only to find his manservant already looking at him, cup clutched so tight in his hand that his knuckles have turned white. He could do it, he realizes. He could get up from the table, tell Merlin to follow him to his chambers. They could go inside. Lock the door. He can almost hear it now ‒ the sound of the bolt sliding into place, can hear the gentle crackle of the fire when he asks Merlin to light it for him. He could stand in front of Merlin, reach out and grab the hem of his tunic. Pull it over his head. Merlin could do the same to him. He imagines watching the flames dance across Merlin’s chest, imagines pulling him flush against him and pressing their lips together, because gods, Merlin’s lips were fucking made for kissing, Arthur thinks, looking at them now, as they sit together in this tavern, far away from the citadel and Arthur’s chambers. He wants to do it. Wants to say it, wants to ask Merlin please? Just one time? Because Arthur thinks that maybe, if he just had Merlin once, it might be enough. And the mere idea of having Merlin at all is earth-shattering, makes him breathless, and Arthur resists the urge to run away again, like he did that evening. Instead, he asks, hoarse, “Do you want to step outside?” Merlin’s eyes widen, and Arthur is sure his mind is analyzing all the different meanings those words hold, and for a second, Arthur thinks he might refuse. But Merlin’s never been able to refuse him ‒ not when he asks like this, at least ‒ and he nods, almost frantic, and breathes, “Okay.” He says it the same way he said Arthur’s name that evening, and now Arthur is standing up from the table, throwing up his hood and walking briskly to the exit. He hears Merlin’s steps behind him, but he hardly needs to, really. He thinks he’d know Merlin’s presence anywhere, anytime, anyplace. He’d know Merlin if they were standing on opposite sides of a battlefield, if they were two people at different ends of a rioting crowd. It’s still sprinkling when Arthur steps outside. He leads them down the alley, to the very end, towards a long-abandoned, worn-down hut. He’s been here enough times to know the lay of the land, to know secret spots and hidden corners. Places to escape to if need be, in case of a fight or an ambush. This isn’t a battle, Arthur knows. But with his heart going wild and his blood thrumming, it sure as hell feels like one. He leads Merlin inside. It’s dark, but the gleaming moon, shining in through the broken window shutters, casts enough light to see by. He hears straw crunch beneath their feet. And then Arthur turns, and Merlin’s standing right there, and Arthur feels like he’s going to fucking die if he doesn’t kiss him right now. Every bone in his body, every bloody thread of his heart, every instinct is telling him to do it. He clenches his fists together, turns his head away from the stricken expression he sees on Merlin’s face. Admits, broken ‒ “ I want you.” Arthur hardly recognizes his own voice for the gravel that’s turned it dark and hoarse. Merlin’s eyes go dark before he squeezes them shut. “I know,” he whispers, the me, too implied in the two words. And his voice is so low, so different from Arthur’s ever heard it sound before, and all he can think is that he wants to hear it over and over again, wants to hear it say Arthur’s name, wants to hear how it sounds when he ‒ Before Arthur even realizes he’s doing it, he’s gripping Merlin’s forearms and shoving him up against the wall of the house. He keeps a distance between their bodies, though, moving his hands to Merlin’s shoulders and pinning them to the wall. Their faces are inches apart, and Merlin’s eyes are wide, pupils blown. They flick to Arthur’s lips, his tongue peeking out to sweep against his own, and Arthur chokes back a groan, breathing in harshly and leaning forward to press their foreheads together. “Fuck,&quot; he whispers. Merlin gives something in between a sigh and a moan, and Arthur screws his eyes shut. A tense silence falls between them. Their breath mingles, the knowledge that Merlin’s lips are right there , that his body is right up against his, enough to make him feel utterly lost, completely gone. He thinks about how their conversation started, about their pure intentions. He thinks about how their only hope was to find some way to work this out without hurting Gwen. Guinevere. The guilt that stabs him is immediate and ice cold. Arthur feels as though he’s been doused with water and shudders. And Merlin knows, he somehow always knows, because he whispers, “I know, Arthur. I know. It’s okay, it’s alright…” He pulls back, reaching up to stroke a gentle thumb across Arthur’s cheekbone. And Arthur is immediately reminded of their journey to Avalon, to that night by the campfire, when Arthur succumbed to exhaustion after telling Merlin, so tenderly, “ I don’t want you to change. ” Right before passing out, he recalls feeling that very same thumb caressing his cheek, recalls feeling utterly at peace, despite the danger ahead. That almost makes it worse, somehow, because what he feels towards Merlin ‒ it’s not just physical attraction. It goes even deeper than that, to the very roots of who Arthur is, of who Merlin is. A half cannot hate that which makes it whole, Merlin had told him when relaying Kilgarrah’s words. And that’s it, isn’t it? Merlin isn’t just someone Arthur loves, isn’t just someone Arthur wants in his bed. He’s the other half of his soul, and Arthur cannot have him. He pulls back, sucking in deep, gasping breaths. Merlin’s hand slides down his face, and when Arthur looks at him, there’s such a deep sadness residing there that seeing it makes Arthur feel as though he’s been struck. “What are we going to do?” he asks, and his voice is almost desperate. “Merlin, I can’t ‒ I can’t do this, we can’t do this! It’s not possible, it’s ‒ ” “I know, Arthur, it’s alright ‒ ” Arthur gives a bitter laugh, cutting him off. “No, Merlin, it’s really not. If it were, we wouldn’t be here, would we?” And now that he’s started, there’s no holding back. “I would be in my chambers with my wife, and you would be married to a lovely woman, too, and we’d be best friends, maybe even battle partners, but nothing more. And we would be okay with that.” He shakes his head, says ‒ “I’m not okay with that. I’m not. And neither are you.” Arthur covers his face with his hands, trying to calm himself, but it’s fairly useless because Merlin is still standing right there, and Arthur knows ‒ he knows ‒ that if he were to give in, were to press his body against Merlin’s, he wouldn’t say no. Or, perhaps he would. Perhaps Merlin would be the one to pull back, to cite honor, to remind him of Gwen. Merlin is, after all, just as concerned with goodness as Arthur is, if not more so. “So, no,” Arthur finishes, hands falling to his sides. “It’s not alright. I don’t think it’s going to be alright. And I don’t know what to do.” His eyes fix on Merlin’s, desperate. “Please tell me what to do.” Because that’s what he’s always done, isn’t it? Whenever Arthur is feeling unsure of himself, of his decisions or his leadership, it’s always been Merlin who he’s turned to. Arthur’s lost track of how many times he’s dragged Merlin to his chambers after meetings, chatting about various things that were discussed in hopes that Merlin would offer his opinion, because the gods forbid he ask for it directly. But this time is different. This time, the decision is about Merlin. About them. And although he knows that Merlin can’t make his choices for him this time around, it isn’t going to stop him from asking. Merlin, however, looks just as helpless as him, just as conflicted and messed up and wild. “I can’t,” he whispers. Arthur knew that this would be the answer, but can’t help the sinking feeling of disappointment that washes over him. He feels bowled over by it. He has had moments of darkness before. He’s found himself in the deepest, blackest pits of despair. Morgana’s betrayal. His father’s death. Agravaine’s betrayal. Merlin’s betrayal. But he’s never, up until this very moment, felt hopeless. Arthur doesn’t say anything, in the end. He just steps back, turns around, and leaves. Leaves again, because he’s afraid. Because he’s sad. Because he can’t bear to see that look on Merlin’s face ‒ the one that says: I love you, and I’m sorry. Please, hurry, leave me, I can’t breath Please don’t say you love me Two weeks pass. They rarely see each other, now. They keep up the pretense as best they can around Gwen ‒ all half-assed banter and plastered grins ‒ but his queen is as clever as they come, and Arthur knows she’s not convinced. When she asks, Arthur decides on a half-truth. “I don’t want to talk about it,” he tells her, trying to sound firm, but he knows that the look he gives her is desperate, that it says: please don’t ask me, please, please, please. Gwen eventually acquiesces to his wishes, but Arthur knows this isn’t over, knows by the worried glances she shoots him during council meetings and shared dinners and the way she’s started going out of her way to avoid him, too. It’s at times like these where Arthur wishes, deep in the recesses of his mind, that he wasn&#x27;t King of Camelot. That he wasn’t king of anything. Because then he could allow himself the luxury of companionship, of having more than one true friend, maybe. But, then ‒ who could he talk to about this? Even if he weren’t a king, there was still the issue of gender, still the issue of society looking down on him for his desires. It makes him feel almost ill, sometimes, when he thinks about how the people he cares about would look at him if they knew. What would Gwen say? Being his wife presents an entirely different issue, but even if they weren’t married, how would she react? Would she be understanding? Disgusted? That thought makes Arthur wince. He doesn’t want to imagine Guinevere ‒ his loving, good Guinevere ‒ looking at him like he’s something to be despised or pitied. What about his knights? Percival and Leon? Would they continue to serve him loyally, or turn on him just as Kay turned on Sir Bran? It’s terrifying to think that something so trivial, so simple and natural as loving someone could make those he cares about reject him. One evening, Arthur is sitting at a chair by the window, attempting to forget his troubles by losing himself in a book ‒ some sort of volume on Camelot’s history ‒ when there’s a soft knock at the door. Arthur would recognize that sound anywhere, so he’s not surprised when Gwen walks in after he gives permission, dressed in that stunning red gown that Arthur has always loved. She gives him a sweet smile, walking up to him and resting a hand on his shoulder, rubbing gently. She peeks at the words on the book’s spine and chuckles softly. “An interesting read, is it?” Arthur gives a quiet snort. “Positively thrilling,” he murmurs, setting the book on the windowsill and turning to face his wife. Seeing her standing there, so open and endlessly loving, makes Arthur feel both safe and guilty. For once, he pushes the latter emotion inside, standing up from his chair and opening his arms. Gwen immediately tucks herself into them, arms circling his waist, face up against his chest. He relishes in the familiar feel of her, in the body he knows well after three years of marriage. “I love you,” he tells her, because he does, and because he thinks she needs to hear it after the way he’s been acting. “I love you, too,” she whispers. A moment later, she pulls back, clasping his hands in hers. “Come to bed with me,” she requests, voice soft and warm with intent. Arthur can’t help it; he immediately tenses, and Gwen notices. There’s a flash of hurt in her dark eyes, and gods, Arthur hates that, hates it more than anything. Because Gwen is goodness incarnate, is the sort of person who should never have to feel hurt at all, especially after everything she’s been through. And here Arthur is, hurting her. But the idea of going to bed with Gwen when he’s spent weeks longing for another is sickening to him, makes him feel positively ill with sheer guilt. And it’s not that he doesn’t desire her, not that he doesn’t want to. It just feels wrong, somehow. As if doing so would make him unfaithful. But that doesn’t make sense, does it? Guinevere is his queen, his wife. She’s the one he’s meant to be faithful too, not… Arthur almost feels himself pale when the realization comes. Because while it’s true that Arthur has been faithful to Gwen when it comes to their bed, to physical expression of love, he hasn’t been so faithful when it comes to what’s in his heart. And now that same heart ‒ his damned foolish heart ‒ is telling him that to sleep with Guinevere tonight would make him unfaithful to another. Arthur has to bite back a grimace, has to take a deep breath to stop the churning in his stomach, the feeling of fear and panic and shame. To Arthur’s horror, Gwen’s face falls and she steps back, letting go of Arthur’s hands as she does so. “It’s alright, Arthur,” she says, giving him a smile that might’ve been convincing if it weren’t for the sadness in her eyes. “I’m sure you must be tired. I’ll leave you to it.” And just like that, she’s leaving, turning and heading out the door. It shuts with a soft thud. But that’s Gwen, he supposes. Always so gentle, whether with people’s hearts, with words, or with chamber doors. A week later, Camelot hosts a banquet to celebrate victory over Morgana, as well as Arthur’s decision to overturn the ban on magic. The law had been signed a few days ago, and in the works ever since Arthur had returned from Camlann. Because despite Arthur’s ongoing sense of betrayal from Merlin’s deception, he’d known in his heart, from the moment Merlin had turned that fire into a dragon, that magic wasn’t evil. Because Merlin had magic. And Merlin, for all his lies and for all his secrets, was not evil. It was the only damn thing Arthur knew for sure. So, the day Arthur had returned to the round table, still tired from his wound but needing to get back to his duties, he’d put the idea up in the air, citing the assistance of sorcery in defeating Morgana’s army as justification. And though it had taken hours upon hours of debating for the council to approve, it was all worth it for the look on Merlin’s face when Arthur turned to him after the meeting was over. Arthur knew that as long as he lived, he’d never forget the pure pride, the pure joy in Merlin’s eyes, and felt such a beautiful warmth in knowing that he’d helped put it there. The banquet is a stunning if somewhat melodramatic affair, complete with singers and musicians from all over the five kingdoms, with entertainers who swallow swords and spit flames. And, of course, platters upon platters of the finest food in Camelot. And wine. Thank the gods for wine, Arthur thinks, motioning for a serving boy to fill up his glass for the fourth time that evening. He ignores the concerned look Gwen shoots him, lifting the cup to his lips and taking a gulp. He has no idea where Merlin is. Arthur spotted him earlier, hanging about with the other servants. He’d been laughing with a serving girl roughly his age, and it had taken every ounce of Arthur’s self-control not to have the head maid, Alwyn, send her away. He hasn’t had quite enough alcohol to do that. He may be getting there, though. It seems that being vulnerable has not only turned Arthur into a coward, but also a lush. The thought is a passing one, but it makes him feel ashamed nonetheless, and he puts his goblet down, scooting it away, as if the distance might lessen the temptation to pick it up again. He notes Gwen giving a subtle nod of approval from the corner of his eye, and for the first time that night, he catches gazes with her and gives her his best attempt at a smile. She quirks an eyebrow and pats his hand before returning to her conversation with a courtier. An hour or so passes, and Arthur manages to stay away from the alcohol by instead spending his time searching the crowd for his useless, annoyingly absent manservant. Gods, just because they’re on the outs doesn’t mean he wants Merlin gone all the time. It hurts when Merlin’s not there. Makes him feel empty. Cold. Of course, it also hurts when Merlin is here. Makes him feel wild. Too warm. As if Arthur were broadcasting his thoughts into the ether, the door to the banquet hall opens and Merlin slips inside. He avoids looking at the head of the table, where Arthur is, instead sliding over to where Gaius sits and leaning down to say something to him. Arthur watches as Gaius gives Merlin a look of pleasant surprise. He mouths something that looks like really? and Merlin gives a nod in reply, a shy smile spreading across his lips. He pats Merlin on the hand and gives a smile of his own ‒ and then Merlin is walking towards Arthur. He’s a bit shocked at the rather straightforward approach ‒ he and Merlin have been seeing each other only when necessary for Merlin’s duties, despite the way the absence makes Arthur’s heart ache ‒ but quickly schools his features as Merlin comes to stand next to him. “Arthur?” he asks. He looks nervous, biting his lip, shifting from foot to foot. “Yes, Merlin?” he asks, curious despite himself. Merlin hasn’t looked this genuinely anxious in a while, their own personal troubles aside. “Since the banquet is celebrating the repeal of the magic ban,” Merlin begins, briefly locking eyes with Arthur before quickly looking away, “I was wondering if you might be open to me doing a...demonstration of some sorts?” And indeed, he looks nervous, but there’s also this lovely hopeful gleam in his eye, a sort of lightness that’s been lacking in Merlin of late. And sure, there are risks to Merlin’s request ‒ there are still so few who know of his magic, for one. But Arthur doesn’t have the heart to be the one to stamp out that hope, so he gives Merlin a smile ‒ his first genuine one in weeks, it feels ‒ and says, “Of course, Merlin.” He gestures to the open space among the tables. “The floor is yours.” A grin spreads across Merlin’s face, and the sight of it fills Arthur with such warmth, such pure fondness. He watches as Merlin gives a quick bow in thanks before making his way to the other end of the hall, where he’ll wait until the current entertainment ‒ a rather talented flute player ‒ is finished. Arthur looks to his left and sees Guinevere looking at him with an expression akin to pride. “That was very good of you, Arthur,” she says. Arthur flushes, and then tries to play it off by shrugging and saying, “Ah, well ‒ the truth had to come out at some point. Now’s as good a time as any.” “Indeed.” He finds his gaze drifting to Merlin once more. His manservant appears to be full of energy, is damn near bouncing on the balls of his feet, hands clasped behind his back. As for Arthur ‒ he can’t help but feel a tad bit excited about Merlin’s display, despite the trepidation that goes along with it. He’s still messed up about Merlin and his deceit, about all he’s kept hidden over the years. Yet he’s also so damn curious. And then there’s that hidden feeling ‒ the one that courses through him, unbidden, when Merlin uses his magic in front of Arthur. The one that surges up when Merlin’s eyes turn gold and he bends the elements to his command. But Arthur doesn’t want to think about that tonight. Not with Gwen right next to him. Not when he’s starting to feel okay, for once. The flute player finishes, taking a bow and grinning at the round of applause that’s given. She hurries from the floor, and then Merlin is stepping forward. Arthur feels as though his heart is stuck in his throat and when he stands, finds that his hands are shaking slightly. Merlin shoots him a curious look, as do the others who are gathered tonight, and it occurs to him that most of the entertainers for the evening have introduced themselves, or been introduced by other nobles. Not one has been given an introduction by the King of Camelot himself. But this is Merlin. He meets his manservant’s eyes, and the hope there ‒ the appreciation ‒ is enough to make Arthur breathless. “I’m sure many of you already know of Merlin,” Arthur begins, and has to hold back a wince when his voice comes out sounding rather scratchy. He clears his throat, tearing his eyes away from Merlin and instead focusing on the faces of those who sit at the tables. “He’s been my loyal manservant for nearly ten years, now. His service, as well as his friendship, have been invaluable to me.” Arthur feels something stirring in his gut as he speaks, realizing that he’s actually nervous about giving a speech for the first time in ages. Four years of being king, of talking to crowds and nobles, to villages full of people, and his heart decides to be anxious in this particular moment. Of course, Arthur thinks, and forges onward. “The full truth of Merlin’s importance, however, is not so simple.” Arthur pauses, looking at Guinevere. He feels her hand squeeze his under the table. He turns his eyes back to the banqueters. “For there is more to Merlin’s service than I ever knew. Only recently did I learn that, and tonight ‒ ” Arthur looks at Merlin, then, and is silent for a moment, because the expression on Merlin’s face ‒ gentle surprise, pride, and love ‒ is enough to stop his very breath. Merlin gives him an almost imperceptible nod. “ ‒ tonight, he would like to show you.” Arthur promptly sits back down, feeling a bit nervous. He can’t help but glance around the hall, reading the expressions of those who are gathered, wondering if they could tell. If they saw the way he looked at Merlin and thought ‒ that isn’t mere friendship. But, of course, no one seems to be thinking that at all. Rather, most eyes are on Merlin, many looking at him with expressions of open curiosity and, in some cases, amusement. Arthur can imagine what they’re thinking. Merlin? The king’s manservant? A nice fellow, sure, but what talents has he got? or This ought to be good; the gods know that Merlin is as half-witted as they come. Arthur thinks of Merlin’s golden eyes, of the power that lurks beneath his manservant’s clever grin, and smirks. Merlin turns to face the head table. He first turns to Gwen, inclining his head and giving her a nervous smile. Gwen is positively beaming at her friend, and Arthur knows she’s probably been anticipating some sort of public display for a while. It was inevitable, he supposes. Then, he turns to Arthur. His nervous smile fades away, replaced by something intense. Something focused. Arthur feels his heart beat faster, feels his chest tighten as Merlin bows, eyes never leaving Arthur’s. “Your majesty,” he says, voice low. Arthur’s head is buzzing with something hot and heady. He nods slightly in return; it’s all he can really muster, at the moment. Then, Merlin turns, walks a few paces away, and flips around to face the head table once more. He raises both hands in front of him. He whispers something in that strange language ‒ Arthur can’t quite make it out through the pounding of his heart in his ears ‒ and then, out of thin air, two dragons of fire appear. The gasps are immediate, and are followed by much quiet murmuring. There’s Merlin, a sorcerer? and The king’s manservant has magic! and Gods, who would’ve thought ? And under normal circumstances, Arthur might be inclined to listen in on the gossip. As it is, he’s far too distracted ‒ too mesmerized ‒ by the sight in front of him. Arthur watches, stunned, as the dragons, each about the size of a hound, begin to fly about the hall, passing over people’s heads and floating up towards the high ceilings. There are exclamations of amazement and mutters of fear. But what strikes Arthur, what hits him like a punch to the gut, are the dragons’ colors. One is undoubtedly Pendragon red, a deep crimson creature. Its movements are fierce and powerful, fast and harsh. The other is cerulean blue. It flies with utter grace, movements flowing and beautiful. The two dragons do a sort of dance together, weaving in and out of each others’ paths. The red dragon bounds ahead, up towards the ceiling, and the blue follows close behind before peeling off, towards the easternmost window. Then it’s the red dragon’s turn to follow. It chases the blue one down, and Arthur watches as the two fiery creatures swirl around each other in a sort of circle, going faster and faster and then ‒ Clap! Arthur jumps in his seat, watching as the two dragons morph into a whirlwind of red and blue flame before vanishing completely, leaving only the vaguest scent of smoke behind. Merlin stands below the spot where they disappeared, hands raised above his head, palms pressed together. He’s breathing hard, which might be strange ‒ Arthur has seen him perform more powerful magic without so much as breaking a sweat ‒ if it weren’t for the fact that he is looking right at Arthur. His eyes ‒ cerulean, the same color as the blue dragon ‒ are almost wild as he gazes at him, and when Arthur looks closely, he realizes that his clasped hands are trembling. And Arthur ‒ Arthur feels as though he can’t breath, as though someone is reaching inside his chest and crushing his lungs with bare hands. He feels dizzy and hot and cold at the same time, feels like everything that’s happened in the past ten years, every interaction he’s ever had with Merlin, has led to this moment, right now. Merlin lowers his hands to his sides, eyes still locked on Arthur. And Arthur ‒ he can’t look away either, can only stare in blatant amazement, blatant wonder. Because it’s obvious what those two dragons were, isn’t it? Pendragon red and cerulean blue. Arthur and Merlin. Merlin and Arthur. And it’s there, in the middle of the banquet hall, with the entire court looking at him and Merlin looking at him, that Arthur realizes that he is doomed to love this man until the end of his life and beyond. He is doomed to love him even when the life leaves his body, when the stars fade and the earth itself crumbles into dust. In whatever lies beyond their world, wherever that may be ‒ Arthur will love him. He rises from his chair, the sound of it scraping against stone as loud as thunder in the otherwise quiet hall. He feels the panic come in full force, the panic and the shame and the fear and ‒ He takes a deep breath, somehow manages to say, “Thank you for your display, Merlin” and, immediately after, “I’ll be retiring for the night. Good evening.” He waves a shaking hand in goodbye ‒ gods, surely they must see? ‒ and all but flees the hall. The door shuts with a resounding bang behind him. The corridor is quiet as Arthur walks, too quiet, and all he can hear is the sound of his heart in his ears. His blood is pumping furiously, much as it does before a fight, and by the time he makes it to his chambers, he feels as though he’s about to crawl out of his skin. Hands shaking ‒ damn it, when did he become so weak? ‒ he pulls the cloak from his shoulders, undressing in record time. He slips on his sleep clothes and goes to stand by the window, placing both hands on the sill and sucking in breath after breath, arms trembling. And he wishes he knew what to do to make this feeling go away, this feeling that’s been taunting him, assaulting him since that first night after his return from Camlann. Gods, Arthur thinks he might even be willing to use magic, use some sort of elixir or spell, if it would make this all go away. Because if this is love ‒ hurting and endless wanting, warmth without an outlet, denial, suppression, pain ‒ then he does not want it. He does not want it. The door to his chambers opens, and Arthur knows by the sound of feet against stone that it’s Gwen. He doesn’t turn around, because he can’t look at her, can’t let her see what must be so clearly written on his face. “Arthur?” The name is spoken so delicately, with such love and concern. Arthur feels as though he might be sick. “Go, Guinevere,” he says. He does not recognize his voice, does not recognize the way it trembles and burns. More footsteps, and then a hand presses gently on Arthur’s shoulder. “Arthur, please, ” she says, sounding desperate. “Won’t you tell me what’s wrong?” She rubs gentle circles, and the usually comforting gesture only makes Arthur feel worse. Guiltier. When Arthur doesn’t answer ‒ is too wrecked by the emotional hurricane he’s been caught in to speak ‒ she continues, sounding as if she’s on the verge of tears herself, “It’s been over a month now, since you returned from Camlann. You’ve been acting so strange, so sad, and something has clearly happened between you and Merlin and I’m just ‒ ” She breaks off suddenly, and the hand on his shoulder grows tighter. “I’m just worried because you’re not telling me, and I can only figure that it’s something awful, and I keep wondering what that is and I’m...I’m frightened, Arthur. For you, and for Merlin.” She pauses, and her voice is so very quiet when she says, “I want you two to be okay again.” Arthur’s palms on the windowsill grow tighter, and he finally opens his eyes, gazing out onto the grounds of the citadel below. I want you two to be okay again. As if he and Merlin will ever be okay again, after tonight. He turns around, finally, still trembling a little. Just as Arthur suspected, Gwen’s eyes gleam with unshed tears, and the sight ‒ his wife, his queen, so lost and confused and sad because of all that Arthur isn’t telling her ‒ nearly breaks him. He covers his face with his hands. Breathes in. Breathes out. His exhale is shaky, and he feels so terrified, so fucking terrified. He hears the ruffle of Gwen’s dress as she moves towards him, feels her hands cover his own. He lets her pull them down and clasp them in her own. Her sweet brown eyes gaze up into his. “You said you weren’t upset with Merlin over his magic,” she murmurs. “Yet after his demonstration tonight, you just up and left so suddenly, and I...can’t help but wonder if you’re lying to me. If you really are still angry, and just not telling me because you’re ashamed. It’s the only thing that makes sense.” And Arthur ought to be relieved, ought to be grateful that this is how his swift exit will be perceived by the banqueters. He ought to take the out. But he looks into Guinevere’s eyes, sees the pure, unconditional love that resides there, and knows that he can’t. To look directly at such openness and lie would be a betrayal of his greatest values, of all that he is. He recalls standing up to Uther, all those years ago, and proclaiming his love for Gwen. Recalls feeling pride beyond words when they finally married, knowing that he was joining himself for the sake of love, rather than duty. No ‒ love has never been easy for Arthur Pendragon. But he has always, always been true to his heart. No matter the obstacle. No matter the consequences. He has to tell her the truth. Gwen cups his face with her hands and whispers, “Arthur, please. Whatever it is, you can tell me.” She pauses, leans up to kiss him on the lips. Pulls back and says, “I love you.” And Arthur isn’t crying, but as he pulls away from her embrace and goes to stand in front of the fireplace, he feels closer to tears than he has since that evening weeks ago. “It’s not the magic, Gwen,” he says. The words are hoarse, and it takes every bit of courage he’s got in him to keep talking. “I wish it was the magic, but it’s not.” “Whatever it is, Arthur ‒ it’s alright. I won’t be angry, I ‒ ” “That’s because you don’t know,” he says. “You have no idea, Gwen.” He flips around, guilt tearing up his insides. Gwen takes a step back, shocked by the sudden movement, and Arthur watches as a bit of trepidation makes its way onto her face for the first time. Good, Arthur thinks. She’ll need to prepare herself for this one, because if her little speech about Merlin’s magic moments ago is true ‒ if that’s really all she suspects ‒ then his wife is about to be blindsided. His breath comes faster and he keeps looking at Gwen, just stares brokenly, as if hoping she’ll somehow know, and he won’t have to tell her. It’s kind of ironic, he thinks distantly, that after spending weeks trying to hide even a hint of his feelings, he’s hoping she’ll guess it just by looking him in the eye. But no matter how clever Guinevere is ‒ no matter how good she is at reading him ‒ she’ll never know unless Arthur tells her. He’s spent too long repressing it, too long denying it, has overcompensated for his feelings with insults and mockery and teasing, and really, it’s no fucking wonder that no one’s figured it out, given Arthur has spent the last ten years downplaying Merlin’s importance in his life. “If it’s not the magic,” Gwen asks, “then what happened between you and Merlin?” Arthur looks at her, then ‒ really looks at her ‒ and sees nothing in her eyes save for concern and a little bit of fear from earlier. She has no idea. Arthur has to tell her. He opens his mouth to say it ‒ gods, he swears he’s going to say it ‒ but nothing comes out but choked air. And now Gwen is really worried, even more than before, and now her hands are shaking and she’s stepping forward and saying, “ Please, Arthur, you’re scaring me! Whatever it is, I don’t care, just, please ‒ ” “I’m in love with him.” Silence. Arthur’s eyes are closed. He squeezed them shut the moment he opened his mouth, and he’s glad for it, because he’s never been so scared of anything in his life than he is of the look on Gwen’s face. He turns around, facing the fire, and opens them again. His breathing is ragged and his heartbeat is hammering. He brings his hands to his face once more and finally, finally, sinks to the floor, landing hard on his knees. The sound of it is like the crack of a whip in the absolute quiet. I love you, Arthur had told Merlin weeks ago, in these very chambers, in front of this very fireplace. Three little words. Who knew that was all it took to bring Arthur Pendragon, the Once and Future King, to his knees? The silence stretches on for what feels like hours, broken only by the sound of Arthur’s harsh breathing and Gwen’s quieter, yet no less ragged, breaths from behind. Finally, she whispers, “ Oh. ” One little word, if you could even call it that. Filled with utter shock and little else. Gods, she’s probably too surprised to even feel anything else. Arthur probably feels enough for them both, anyways. He hangs his head, breathes in and out, in and out, trying to bring himself under control. He’d hoped that getting the words out would make it better, make it bearable, but now finds that he’s even more scared than before, because Gwen’s not really saying anything and fuck, he’s gone and ruined everything, hasn’t he? “I never…” Gwen’s voice sounds strange, far-off, as if she’s been so taken aback by Arthur’s confession that it’s caused her to mind to go somewhere else entirely. “I never thought...I didn’t…” Didn’t know. Arthur imagines that’s what she’s probably trying to say. He thinks he should say something else ‒ I’m sorry, maybe? ‒ but his mind is going wild right now, with guilt and fear and love, because he’s still thinking about Merlin, fucking Merlin, and how he’d looked at him in the banquet hall. He feels sick with all the conflicting emotions, feels like he did that first night, when the feeling first came to him and he threw up everything in his stomach until he retched blood. “How long?” Gwen asks, and there’s something else creeping into her tone now, something that’s causing her voice to shake. He’s not sure if it’s anger or sadness. He’s not sure he wants to know. “I don’t really know,” Arthur answers honestly, after a long moment. The words are quiet and gravelly, and he slumps even further, sliding off of his knees and sitting on the floor instead, pulling one leg up. He runs a hand through his hair, over and over. Wipes the sweat from his forehead. “What does that mean?” Gwen asks, voice trembling, and Arthur gets his answer: anger. “I don’t...I just don’t ‒ it’s ‒ I don’t think I really knew until ‒ ” “Really knew? What does that mean, Arthur?” “I don’t know, Gwen, I ‒ ” He shakes his head, glad that he’s turned away, because now he knows that she’s angry and he can’t bear it, can’t bear to see another person that he loves turn against him. Of course, this time it’s Arthur’s fault. Arthur’s fault and no one else’s. “It’s hard to explain,” he finishes, and Gwen makes a sound not unlike a scoff, only much more hurt. “It’s really not, Arthur,” she says, her voice somehow both completely cold and completely broken. “How long have you been in love with him?” “I don’t know, Gwen,” he says, and now he’s getting angry, and gods, this is all so messed up. “It’s not that simple ‒ ” “Arthur, look at me !” The words are like a jolt to Arthur’s heart, sending shock waves of pain through his chest. Gwen has never raised her voice like this before; he’s never seen her so angry, and he realizes he has no idea what to say or do. Yet when Arthur turns around, it’s not anger that he sees on Gwen’s face. It’s pain. Pure, visceral hurt. Tears are streaming down her face, and it occurs to Arthur that this is why her voice has been shaking. And there is some anger there, Arthur realizes. It’s in the clench of her fists and the firm line of her lips, but it’s all overshadowed by the sadness that emanates from her. Sadness and confusion, and shock, too, as if a part of her still can’t believe it. “I’m trying to ask,” she says, eyes burning into his, lips trembling, “if you married me knowing that you loved another.” She pauses, dips her head a little, breaking eye contact. “If you ever loved me at all.” Her voice cracks on the final word, and then she’s burying her face in her hands and crying. And it’s a soft sort of cry, more delicate than devastating, yet Arthur almost wishes she would sob instead, wishes she would scream and rage and weep until she fell to her knees, just as he had. All of that would be easier to bear than the quiet, broken tears she’s shedding now. If this were any other moment, Arthur would get up, walk over there and cradle her in his arms. He’d fit his body to hers, like he did that night in Ealdor, four years ago now, would tuck his face into her neck. He’d whisper sweet nothings and kiss the tears off of her lips, and they’d both know that it would all be okay eventually. This is not that moment. But he also can’t say nothing, cannot possibly let Gwen think that what she has just suggested is the truth. “Guinevere,” he says. When she doesn’t look up, just stands there crying ‒ Arthur’s heart is breaking ‒ he repeats himself. “ Guinevere. ” She looks up, finally, sucking in a deep breath, as if to prepare herself. “I love you,” Arthur says. “I loved you when I married you, and I love you now. I swear on all there is ‒ on my mother’s grave ‒ that it’s true.” There’s a very long moment of quiet, in which Arthur stares and Gwen stares back, and the fire burns low in the hearth, and the darkness of the evening grows heavier yet. Finally, she nods. She doesn’t look surprised, but he does catch a hint of relief in her eyes, in the way her body loosens a little, shoulders dropping slightly. “I believe you,” she says. She does. Arthur can tell. He’s just not sure it matters. He pulls his eyes away, staring at the stone floor as the moments tick by in silence. It’s too difficult to look at Gwen when she’s like this. Although Arthur knows it’s only been minutes, it feels like it’s been hours when Gwen moves once more. She walks from the table over to a dresser near the fireplace, all the while keeping the distance between her and Arthur. He shifts towards her as she does so, so he’s still facing her, sensing that she’s about to speak. She turns to face him directly, firelight sparking off the tear stains on her cheeks, and lifts her chin. And Arthur recognizes that look, knows it in his bones. It’s the same one she gave him nine years ago, right before she told him off for the awful behavior he’d shown while staying in her home. The same one she gives him now, when she’s about to tell him something he doesn’t want to hear, and Arthur immediately knows what she’s about to ask. “Have you slept with him?” And the mere idea of that is enough to send part of Arthur somewhere else, to make his whole body go hot and his jaw clench, so hearing it spoken aloud makes his mind go nearly blank. He takes a moment to gather himself, to breath in deeply before saying, “No.” Then, more ardently, “I wouldn’t do that to you, Gwen. I wouldn’t. I swear.” The memory slams right into him, of that night in the tavern and the abandoned hut afterwards, of the way he’d pressed Merlin into the wall. The way Merlin’s eyes went completely dark and that little sound he’d made. Arthur clenches his fists, shoves the memory away. But something of it must be written on his face, because a moment later, Gwen whispers, “You want to, though.” It’s not a question, and yet Arthur gets the sense that she’s waiting for some sort of response. But Arthur doesn’t say anything. How could he? He’d either have to lie to his wife or admit to something so deeply buried that speaking it aloud might rip a hole right through him. Perhaps it’s a blessing, then, that Gwen seems to take his silence as an answer in and of itself. She nods, biting her lip, and looks away from him. And the worst thing of all, Arthur thinks, is that it’s not even as simple as him wanting to take Merlin to bed. He wants it ‒ gods, does he want it ‒ but it’s so much more than that. He wants Merlin’s stupid, overly cheerful morning grins. He wants his counsel, his nods of approval when Arthur does something particularly kingly, as Merlin likes to put it. He wants Merlin’s sparkling blue eyes on him, wants his words of comfort in those moments when Arthur feels the weight of his duties crushing him, burying him under layers of fear and worry. He even wants the magic, wants that feeling he gets when Merlin’s eyes turn gold, when his being lights up with the power that lurks within. He wants all of him, wants nothing less than Merlin in his baffling, beautiful entirety. And even though he knew that already ‒ even though these are the exact thoughts that have been plaguing him for weeks now, damn near tortuous ‒ it hits him even harder now that Gwen is here, a witness to the storm inside him, and suddenly it’s just all too much. There’s anger and sadness, desire and guilt, and it’s all coursing through him all at once and he’s just sick of it, sick of feeling. He stands up abruptly, dizzy and off-balanced and wild, and begins to pace back and forth in front of the fireplace, needing some outlet for this impossible energy. He gets this urge to break something, perhaps; he thinks about storming over to the window, pulling back his arm and launching his fist into the glass, thinks that the pain and the crack of the shatter might do something to calm the chaos inside his head. But then he’d be bleeding, would have to go to Gaius and have the physician pull the bits of glass from his hand. And wherever Gaius is, Merlin is usually not far off. And besides ‒ no matter what he’s feeling right now, he’s learned to reign in his temper over the years. He’s the King of Camelot, and he’s mastered the art of self-control in almost all areas of his life. And although it’s always been most difficult for him when it comes to matters of the heart, Arthur has no desire to act out in some petty, childish way. He’s better than that, if nothing else. Just because he doesn’t do it, though, doesn’t mean the urge fades. Clenching his fists, Arthur stops his pacing and decides that the only way to sort through his feelings is to say something, say anything. He faces Gwen. She’s in the same spot as earlier, eyes wide and emotive as she watches him, still red-rimmed from the tears. She’s stopped crying, though; she seems to have settled on a more solemn sort of melancholy. She has both arms wrapped around her stomach, as if she’s ill. Arthur imagines her feelings of queasiness echo his own. “I’m sorry,” Arthur says, as if that could possibly make this any better. The naive part of him ‒ the part he usually keeps a tight leash on, usually recognizes for its childishness ‒ wishes that it somehow would, that Arthur could just apologize and Gwen could say I forgive you and that would be all. But apologies won’t cut it this time, and Arthur is suddenly wracked with the urge to just say it, to just let it all out because he’s not sure he’s going to get another chance. So he does. “I didn’t mean for it to happen,” he begins. “I didn’t ‒ I just got back from Camlann and I was lying in bed and thinking about everything, and I just sort of realized it. It just hit me, out of nowhere. Everything we said while we were journeying to Avalon, it’s like it just ‒ just ripped something out of me, something buried so deeply that I...” He swallows, tearing his eyes away from Gwen, because this is where it gets hard. “You asked me earlier how long and I ‒ I would be...lying to you if I said that it never occurred to me, that I never thought about it. There were times when I would, but only for a moment. Only a little, and not in any... real way. I think, maybe…” He trails off for a moment, lifting his eyes to Gwen. Her expression is written in shades of hurt and sorrow, of betrayal, because she knows what he’s about to say. “I think I always knew. Maybe.” He squeezes his eyes shut. Shakes his head and sucks in a deep breath, and finishes, so very softly ‒ “I knew.” Because he had, hadn’t he? He’d had those flickering moments of longing, of wanting, but they would only surface for a moment before Arthur would shove them down, beat them into submission with all the fury he would show an enemy in battle. It was only when he and Merlin traveled to Avalon together, when Arthur finally, finally let himself be vulnerable in a way he’d never let himself before, that it all came rushing in on him. He’d been falling in love all along, slowly ‒ perhaps since the very day they met, when Merlin had looked at him with those sparkling blue eyes the first time, with that cheeky grin ‒ and their journey, and all that was said and shared between them, was the final crash to the ground. “And yet you married me,” Gwen says, after a long moment. Arthur opens his eyes, looking his wife in the eye because it’s what she deserves, no matter how much it hurts to do so. Gwen deserves nothing less than the best ‒ always has, and always will. “Because I loved you, Guinevere,” he says, and flushes at the way his voice cracks. “I still do. And ‒ ” He cuts himself off, shaking his head. “What?” “It’s not important ‒ ” “Gods, Arthur, please. ” Gwen’s eyes are pleading. “Just tell me. I’m not a weak-hearted damsel. I can handle it.” Arthur sighs, going over to the mantle and placing his hands up against it. The heat from the flames has turned less harsh, has died down as the night wears on. Arthur almost wishes it would burn, would hurt. It’s the least he deserves after breaking Guinevere’s heart. “It’s not like anything could’ve happened between us,” he says. The words are a mere echo of the terrible truth that has brought them forth, of the deep set hopelessness that Arthur has always felt, on some level, when it comes to how he feels for Merlin. “I recall you saying something similar about our courtship,” Gwen reminds him. Arthur winces. “It’s hardly the same, Guinevere.” “How so?” she questions, defiant. Arthur feels the heat of sudden anger sweep through him, and he digs his fingers into the stone of the mantle, biting his lip. He doesn’t want to yell at her. She doesn’t deserve that. “He’s a man, Guinevere,” Arthur bites out, and is shocked when she gives an almost angry scoff. “Yes,” she acquiesce, “he is. And while that might mean you could never marry, never have children, it hardly means that you could never have made it work in some way. There are many ways of loving someone, but you never even tried, Arthur!” And now Arthur is getting confused. He turns to face her, eyebrows pulled together. “You almost sound as if you’re angry with me for...for not choosing him, instead.” Gwen gives a bitter laugh, shaking her head and now she’s turning away. She walks a few paces towards the door, slowly, before spinning around and saying, “I am angry, Arthur! I’m angry and I’m hurt because you love someone else ‒ ” Her voice cracks, and Arthur’s afraid she’s about to cry once more. But she takes a deep breath, pulling herself together, and continues, “ ‒ but I’m also disappointed and confused, because that’s not you , Arthur!” “Not me? What are you ‒ ” “For as long as I have known you,” Gwen interrupts, and she’s clearly on a roll now, one that Arthur doesn’t have the strength to stand in the way of, “you have always been true to your heart, above all else. When it comes to your kingdom, you’ll do your duty. You’ll do what you have to. But when it comes to the people you love ‒ ” She breaks off once more, looks him deeply in the eye, and Arthur almost sees something akin to admiration there, among all the other more awful emotions. “When it comes to the people you love, you’ll let nothing stand in your way. Gods, Arthur, I was a servant, and you married me anyways, because you loved me. You knew how people would look at it, knew that there would be those who disapproved, who saw you as lesser because of our union. But you didn’t care.” She pauses, letting her words sink in. Then ‒ “I just don’t understand why it’s different with him. ” And gods, Arthur has no idea how to explain that, how to tell her that when it comes to Merlin, everything is different. That his feelings for Merlin are deeply complex, derived from years of secret longing. That their very souls are entwined, as fated by destiny itself, that Arthur’s love for him is so powerful, so very connected to the essence of who Arthur is , that it terrifies him. How does one look that sort of love in the eye and not feel afraid of it? “It’s hard to explain,” he says, finally. She lifts her chin once more. Looks at him directly, with all the hurt and defiance and love she feels for him on full display. “Try.” He turns away from the fire, away from Gwen. He walks over to the table, all but collapses into one of the chairs, bringing his elbows up and resting them on the wood. He entwines his fingers together, waiting quietly while Gwen comes to sit next to him. “It’s like…” Arthur is flushing hard, and he’s barely even started speaking yet. He looks resolutely away from Gwen, fixes his eyes on the grain of the wood, traces over the lines and bumps, all the while trying to calm his racing heart. “What I feel for ‒ for him ‒ it’s...overwhelming.” And gods, this is awful. Just these few words are enough to make Arthur feel as though he’s stripped bare. But Gwen asked, and after all the hell he’s put her through tonight, he is going to explain, even if it eats him up until he’s raw and bloody. “It’s as though he’s...a part of me, like…” Arthur shakes his head, moves a hand up, running it through his hair. “Like if he were to ever leave, half of me would go with him. And just the thought of that, of him leaving, or dying ‒ ” Arthur has to choke that word out. “ ‒ makes me feel sick and cold. And sometimes he looks at me and I ‒ it’s like I can’t breathe, like tonight, in the hall. After he was done, I was just looking at him and I realized that I’ll never ‒ ” He breaks off, then, letting his entwined hands drop to the table, nails digging into the wood. “I realized that I’ll never stop feeling like this.” He looks up at Gwen, into her eyes that hold so much ‒ sadness and heartbreak and pure compassion ‒ and says, nearly whispering, “I love him, Guinevere. I love him in a way I never thought possible.” And then he’s done. He can’t say any more because his face is burning and his hands have begun to shake. Hell, his whole body feels as though he’s caught fire, and he’s not sure if it’s embarrassment, guilt, or shame. Probably all three. Part of him expects Gwen to be angry, to be mournful. And while Arthur can see both of these things in the way she looks at him, there’s something incredibly thoughtful in her expression. It’s the way she gets when she’s musing, when she’s in a pensive sort of mood, and a moment later she says, “I think I know what you mean.” Her voice is still a bit hoarse from crying. She reaches up to wipe at her eyes and then continues, “When I first met Lancelot, all those years ago...I felt much the same. I was drawn to him, and when he died, I felt as though ‒ ” She stops abruptly, squeezing her eyes shut, and Arthur’s heart aches at the resurgence of her old grief. She takes a very deep breath and opens her eyes once more. “I felt as though there was this hole in me. Like he took something vital when he left.” She meets Arthur’s gaze. “Something I could never get back.” He immediately gets the implications of the words: something even you could not replace, and he feels no anger. Only a deep, visceral sadness on behalf of his beautiful, graceful wife. His queen. “I’m sorry,” Arthur says, for what must be the tenth time that night ‒ only this time, he knows precisely what he’s apologizing for. If Guinevere felt for Lancelot even a fraction of what Arthur feels for Merlin, he can only imagine the pain his death caused her, both times. He thinks of Merlin dying and returning to him, only to be ruthlessly ripped away once more, and feels as though a pit has opened in the bottom of his stomach, deep enough to drown in. Gwen only nods, as if she knows what he is thinking. “It seems we’ve both had a difficult time when it comes to love,” Arthur murmurs, attempting to dredge up a small smile. He thinks it comes out as more of a grimace, though. Ever gracious, Gwen gives a tiny, choked laugh and a wry, watery smile. “Indeed.” And then there’s the question, hanging in the air over both of their heads. It’s so obvious, so glaring, but Arthur cannot bring himself to voice it. He still feels raw, feels cut open and bare, and wants nothing more than to drag himself to his bed and lay there for a very long time. Possibly forever, if he could get away with it. In the end, it’s Guinevere who has the bravery to say it. “You said,” she begins, “that you think you’ll feel this way forever. That it’s not something you can merely wait out.” “Yes,” Arthur says quietly. Guiltily. Almost says I’m sorry, but knows it’s pointless. There’s a long moment of silence, then, in which a number of emotions flash across Gwen’s face. Hurt. Betrayal. Anger and understanding. Then she straightens, placing both of her hands on the table, and, to Arthur’s surprise, reaches forward to grab one of his. She squeezes it, and he meets her eyes. She says ‒ “I think we both know what needs to happen now.” But Arthur doesn’t. He has no idea what to do, is confused as to why Gwen thinks the answer is so obvious. He shakes his head. “Gwen, I ‒ I don’t. I’ve been doing nothing but thinking about this for weeks, and I just...I don’t see a way out of this. Not a way that won’t hurt you.” Guinevere’s lips tip up into the sweet, sad smile. “I’m stronger than I look, Arthur,” she says, and suddenly Arthur understands. He immediately stands up, shaking his head once more. He keeps ahold of her hand, squeezes it tighter and says, “ No, Gwen.” She continues on as if he hasn’t spoken. “Do you know what I love about you more than anything else?” She doesn’t wait for an answer, looking deep into Arthur’s eyes as she says, “How passionately you love. In so many ways, you’re the most controlled man I know. You’re precise and strategic, and you’ve mastered your temper much better than your father ever did.” She pauses, as if giving him space to protest. He doesn’t. “Yet when it comes to love, you...you throw yourself into it. You might not say all that you feel, but you show it in the most incredible ways. You risk your life on dangerous quests, you put aside your prejudices. You defy your father. Your king. “It’s terrifying, sometimes, to be on the receiving end of that. There have been times where you’ve done something reckless to keep me from harm, and it’s made me so angry. So worried. But other times, it’s like...like staring into the sun itself, bearing nearly blinded but unable to look away. It’s wild and passionate and beautiful. ” Arthur flushes hard at that, moving shiftily on his feet and looking down at the hand that’s still gripping Gwen’s. “I could never live with myself,” Gwen continues, and Arthur spies the gleam of tears in her eyes. “if I were to deny Merlin the chance to know what that feels like. And I could never live with myself to deny you him, either. Not when I know that love, when I understand what it would mean for you to keep that locked inside.” For a moment, Arthur is speechless. He can only look at Gwen ‒ his wife ‒ and feel completely, utterly undeserving of the compassion she is showing him. “I won’t do it, Gwen,” he whispers. “I won’t betray you.” Gwen laces her fingers through his own and stands up from her chair. She places a hand on his cheek. “You won’t have to.” He tells her no, over and over again, but Guinevere won’t have it. There are too many risks, Arthur says. Her reputation won’t survive. She’ll be a commoner once more, yet will still likely be recognized by the citizens of Camelot, many of whom will be inclined to treat her as lesser due to all of this ‒ which means she’ll probably have to leave Camelot, if she is to live in peace. All of it makes Arthur sick with guilt, and he is relentless in his insistence that she stay, that she continue to be his queen. “I’ll be okay,” he says to her, pleadingly, even as a part of him, deep in his heart, tells him to stop, tells him to let it happen, to take the opportunity she’s handing him so openly. “Me and Merlin ‒ we’ll figure something out. We’ve gone this long without ‒ without anything, we can keep ‒ ” Gwen raises a hand, cutting him off. “Arthur,” she tells him, in that determined, you cannot persuade me voice of hers. “I’m not going to change my mind.” She’s in the midst of packing some of her things when she tells them this ‒ it’ll take a few days to get everything ready, and that’s not including the official documentation they’ll have to do ‒ and Arthur is about to protest when there’s a knock on the door. Arthur knows that knock. He freezes, not saying anything. Gwen gives him a hard look, keeping her eyes on him as she raises her voice to call out, “Come in.” Merlin walks in, already speaking. “I was hoping you could tell me where to find ‒ ” He stops when he sees them. “ ‒ Arthur.” Arthur coughs awkwardly, heartbeat quickening. “Merlin,” he acknowledges. “I think I recall telling you to work on that speech for next week.” Merlin’s momentarily startled expression slides into the one they’ve both been using around Gwen for weeks now, the fairly convincing one with a dry twist of a smile. “You did, sire. At least five times, I think. That’s actually why I was hoping to speak with you.” He moves further into the room, and Arthur can see he’s holding a piece of parchment in his hands. Arthur watches as Merlin looks up from what he presumes is a speech draft and, for the first time, takes in the sight of the bags of Gwen’s bed. He stops walking. The hand holding the parchment falls to his side, expression turning puzzled. To anyone else, he might seem merely curious. But Arthur knows every quirk of the eyebrow, knows every smile and frown, and understands that the look in his eye signals caution. “Are you going somewhere, Gwen?” he asks, still eyeing the bags. Arthur watches as his eyes scan all that lies there, sees the moment where Merlin catches sight of the winter clothing. Clothing she wouldn’t need unless she was going on a very, very long trip. Merlin’s entire body stiffens. His eyes flick between Arthur and Gwen, back and forth a few times before settling on Arthur. His expression tightens. Then he asks, very quietly, “What did you do?” Arthur tenses and remains silent. Merlin’s presence has already stirred up the usual emotions ‒ sadness and confusion, guilt and want ‒ and now Arthur feels even more unbalanced, unprepared for Merlin’s anger. His accusation. Because Merlin is staring daggers at him, and there’s a quiet fury in the way he holds himself, in how he lifts his chin as he looks Arthur directly in the eye. “Arthur,” he says, voice hard. And then Gwen is stepping forward, towards Merlin. “Merlin,” she begins, said man’s eyes flicking over to her, immediately turning softer as they do. That changes, though, when Gwen says, “This was my choice.” That softness turns to hurt , to confusion. Those dark blue eyes turn wide, and he shakes his head. “No,” he says, voice cracking, almost as if he’s in denial. “No, Gwen ‒ you can’t ‒ ” “I can, and I am. ” “Gwen, please, you don’t have to do this.” Merlin’s face is pained, and he sets the parchment down on the table before approaching Gwen, as if he wants to reach out, but stops right in front of her instead. He twists his hands together, a tell-tale sign of anxiety that Arthur has learned to recognize over the years. “Arthur and I ‒ ” Arthur doesn’t miss the way Merlin’s voice catches on his name, the way Merlin briefly looks at him, face shadowed with guilt and something else. “ ‒ we’re just…” He swallows hard. “Whatever he told you, it doesn’t change the fact that you ‒ you’re his wife. Gwen. His queen. You can’t leave. He needs you.” Merlin is right, of course. Arthur does need Gwen. He loves her, has been married to her for three years, now. Her love, her very presence ‒ it’s a vital part of who Arthur is, and as he stands here now, imagining her leaving him for good, he feels terrified and sick. But then he looks to Merlin ‒ Merlin, who is his rock. His guiding light, his other half. And he cannot possibly imagine living without him, either. It’s Gwen who ends up stepping forward. She reaches out, grabbing Merlin’s hands in her own. “I know,” she says softly. “But he needs you, too. In a way that he will not let himself unless I go.” There’s a very long moment where Merlin just stares at her, shocked and guilty and so, so sad. And then he whispers, “I don’t want you to go, Gwen,” and Arthur’s heart just breaks. Merlin and Gwen have been friends for longer than Arthur has loved her. He imagines that the prospect of Gwen’s departure is almost as painful for him as it is for Arthur. Gwen smiles then, and it’s so very brave of her. But Arthur can see the pain in her eyes, and although he wants to look away ‒ wants to pretend this isn’t happening ‒ he doesn’t. To do so would be cowardly, and Arthur is done running away. “This isn’t goodbye, Merlin,” she says. “I’ll still come back and visit, and once I settle down, I’ll write. Then, you can come and see me whenever you’d like.” She looks at Arthur, then. “Both of you can.” And Arthur realizes, quite suddenly, that she’s going to do this. No matter what he or Merlin say, she’s made up her mind. She’s got a plan already, from the sound of it ‒ probably even has a destination picked out. That won’t stop him from trying one more time. He steps forward, towards both of them. He glances at Merlin, and as the two catch eyes, he realizes that his manservant has come to the same conclusion. He turns to Gwen, and she to him, letting go of Merlin’s hands. She lifts her chin, and something in Arthur just aches in the face of her pure determination. “You don’t have to do this,” he tells her, putting every ounce of conviction that he has into the words. “You can stay. You can stay. ” Gwen shakes her head. And unlike the night before, her eyes are clear of tears, although Arthur can see the quiet sorrow that lurks in them. “I love you, Arthur,” she says. Her voice is softer than Arthur has ever heard. “But I cannot ‒ ” she pauses. Shakes her head. “ ‒ will not be married to someone who loves another.” When Arthur opens his mouth to protest, Gwen cuts him off. “I know you love me, too. But after everything you told me, and…” She trails off, looking at Merlin meaningfully. Said man looks away, biting his lip, eyes wet. “...and after seeing you two now, I almost feel a bit silly. It’s quite obvious once you know to look for it.” Arthur feels his cheeks heat. “I know you, Arthur,” she goes on. “And your honor will never allow you to be with Merlin while you’re still married to me. But I have honor, too. Principles. And I will not stay with someone whose heart does not fully belong to me.” She pauses, then, looking down. A shadow crosses her face. “Perhaps that makes me selfish. A hypocrite, even.” She meets Arthur’s eyes, and he knows that she’s thinking of Lancelot, now, and how part of her heart will always belong to a man long dead. “But it’s true.” Arthur’s previous sense of panic is beginning to die down, replaced by the sorrow of realization, of understanding that Guinevere ‒ his wife and queen ‒ is going to be gone in a few days, somewhere away from the castle. Away from Camelot. Away from him. “At least…” Arthur’s voice is hoarse. “At least let me do something for you, Gwen.” She looks at him, and he watches her, sees the moment where she understands that he is going to let her go. A mixture of emotions ‒ relief, sadness, compassion ‒ flashes across her face, and she gives a sort of subtle nod, more to herself than to him. “I’ll be alright, Arthur,” she says, and he shakes his head. “No, Gwen ‒ ” He steps forward, takes both of her hands and squeezes them tight. “Please. Let me do this.” She must see the desperation on his face, because she eventually nods. “Okay.” Arthur lets out a deep breath, feeling that tightness in his chest loosen, just a bit. “When you settle down, write to me. I’ll send you gold each month. And if you ever need some sort of favor ‒ bandits, sorcery, even a few villagers giving you trouble ‒ I’ll help you.” She raises an almost admonishing eyebrow. “I’ll likely move away from Camelot, Arthur. If you were to ever send men to another kingdom ‒ ” He raises a hand, cutting her off. He gives her a small smile, born of a deep, long-felt love and an affection he knows will never fade, no matter the years and the distance between them. “For you, Guinevere,” he says, “I would happily go to war.” Gwen leaves three days later. Arthur spends the next three in his rooms, mostly, missing whatever meetings he can, drinking wine, and overall feeling quite terribly sorry for himself. He’s not sure how the explanation they gave for the separation ‒ irreconcilable differences ‒ is being received by the castle, by the people of Camelot. Arthur knows how to access the gossip channels, knows how to get a general sense of what’s being said about him and his rule, as well as his personal life, but he doesn’t want to know. Not yet, at least. Merlin mostly stays away, most likely assuming that Arthur needs his space. And he’s right, Arthur supposes, but he’s also not right. Because despite all that’s happened ‒ despite the shame and guilt whirling around inside him ‒ he’s still sick with want. Each time Merlin steps inside his room, he’s fucking overcome with it. And now, whenever they meet eyes, there’s that unspoken truth hanging in the air. We could. But Arthur is still haunted by the guilt he feels, still restless and heartsick at Gwen’s sudden departure from his life. So they don’t. Two weeks pass. It gets easier, and soon Arthur is relearning what normal means. He goes to all of his round table meetings, does training with his knights, and attends feasts and banquets as he’s supposed to. He drafts policies and talks with citizens, goes on patrols and hunts. And slowly, day by day, the hole in his heart begins to mend. He still feels Guinevere’s absence, feels it like the sharp tip of a sword in his gut. He finds that there are certain times of the day when it’s worse ‒ in the evenings, when they used to dine together, and at banquets, when she used to sit at his left. But it hurts less and less as time passes. And although Arthur suspects that her departure has left a scar that will always cause him pain, he takes comfort in knowing that Gwen ‒ with her pure sweetness, with her wit and loving nature ‒ will almost certainly find love once more. As for Arthur? He is still scared. Still wild with emotion. He and Merlin slowly start to see each other more as the days go by and Arthur’s pain over Gwen begins to lessen, and each moment Arthur spends in Merlin’s presence feels both terrifying and hopeful. He hurts. He aches. He wants. And Arthur keeps waiting for the right moment to bring it up ‒ to say something. But each time he and Merlin lock eyes, the desire is accompanied by fear. Because Arthur has spent so long repressing this, has spent so long not allowing himself to want, and now that he can ‒ now that he and Merlin actually have a chance ‒ he’s almost more terrified. He has no idea what’s coming next, or when it will come, or what it will mean. He can tell that Merlin is feeling the same way, too. The two dance around each other constantly, stealing glances when they think the other isn’t looking (they almost always are) and exchanging casual touches. A brush of fingers there, when Merlin passes him something, or Arthur’s hand on Merlin’s shoulder. They spend evenings together, sometimes, in Arthur’s chambers. And there’s always this something in the air, this tension, all born of a desire kept hidden so long that to act on it now seems impossible, despite the fact that it isn’t. Arthur glances at Merlin, sometimes, and almost says it. He watches Merlin polish his armor and sharpen his sword, brow furrowed in concentration, and Arthur’s fingers twitch with the urge to reach out and touch Merlin’s arm. Just once touch would do it, Arthur thinks. One touch and one meaningful look, and Merlin would be his. His. Just that one word is enough to make Arthur feel dizzy. Arthur knows it has to be him. Merlin won’t be the one to initiate; he’s waiting for Arthur to make the first move. Waiting until Arthur is completely sure. One evening, when a month has gone by, Arthur is watching as Merlin finishes up his duties, tidying Arthur’s chambers. “Why don’t you use magic?” Arthur finds himself asking, after spending nearly ten minutes observing Merlin put clothes away, pick up various items and toss them into chests, and a variety of other menial tasks. He thinks that such things must be terribly boring and would certainly get done much faster if Merlin were to use his gifts. A small part of him thinks ‒ hopes ‒ that Merlin chooses to do these things by hand to extend his time in Arthur’s chambers, but that’s almost certainly wishful thinking. Right? Merlin gives him a slightly surprised look, eyebrows raised, as he puts the final piece of Arthur’s clothing in the laundry basket by his drawer. And then he asks, “Do you want me to?” Arthur just stares at him for a moment, blinking, and when an almost knowing smirk slowly spreads across Merlin’s face, he flushes. Hard. “It has nothing to do with what I want,” Arthur snaps. “I don’t care what you do, Merlin.” “Right,” Merlin says, blue eyes dancing. “I suppose that’s why you blush every time I use my magic in front of you.” “I do not ‒ ” “You do. Don’t worry, though.” Merlin walks over to the table where Arthur sits, drinking a cup of water before bed and already dressed in his nightclothes. Merlin leans up against the edge a few feet away and crosses his arms, looking down at Arthur with a grin. “It’s flattering.” Arthur scowls. “It’s hardly my intention to flatter you, Merlin,” he says, and then flushes even harder because he’s just inadvertently admitted that Merlin is right. Clever bastard, Arthur thinks. He glares at Merlin as he takes a gulp of water, but Merlin just looks back at him with that same grin. It slowly lessens, though, as he watches Arthur, eyes flicking down to his throat as Arthur swallows. And now Arthur is getting very warm, and even as he sets down the cup, Merlin just keeps looking at him, just looking, doing that stupid thing with his eyes that he’s supposedly unaware of. “What do you want me to do?” Merlin asks, rather suddenly. And it ought to break the tension, but the way he says it ‒ slow and careful, voice low ‒ only makes Arthur’s heart beat faster. “I’d like you to actually do your chores for once, Merlin,” Arthur says, but as attempts at humorous banter goes, this one is sort of ruined by the way he keeps looking at Merlin’s lips. “I’ve just finished,” Merlin says. “But if you want to see me use my magic, I’d be happy to oblige.” There’s an almost mischievous sparkle in his eye, along with something else. Something darker. Arthur finds that it’s getting a little harder to breathe, and although he ought to say something quite witty in response to Merlin’s assumptions about what Arthur wants, he finds that he can only nod. “Whatever you want,” he says, a moment later, and gods, what a humiliating thing to say. But now Merlin is nodding and walking away from the table, towards the center of the room. Arthur turns around, following him with his eyes. Facing him, Merlin simply stares at Arthur for a long moment, a smile curving his lips. His hands are clasped behind his back, and Arthur is wondering how he’s going to use his magic like that when, suddenly, the fire goes out and the room is thrown into darkness. There’s still the light cast by the moon, though, bright enough that Arthur can still see Merlin standing there, can make out the tall, lanky form that he’s memorized after years and years of watching, of quiet observation, of time spent together in battle. Merlin holds out a palm. His eyes turn gold, and a sphere of light forms above his open hand. And even though Arthur already knew that it was Merlin who guided him in the caves ‒ Merlin had told him that evening, the night of stories that seems so long ago, now ‒ there’s something heartstopping about actually seeing it happen, about watching as the beautiful ‒ and yes, it’s beautiful, Arthur thinks ‒ piece of magic that led him to safety form in Merlin’s hands. The orb casts the room in a stunning glow, the blue hue of the light making Merlin’s cerulean eyes even brighter than usual. He looks at Arthur and smiles so very softly, and Arthur thinks that he’s never seen a sight so ethereal. He is speechless. Stunned. Here is all the proof of everything that Merlin has done for him, of everything he has sacrificed for Camelot. As if he can hear Arthur’s thoughts, he says, so quietly, “For you, Arthur.” I have magic, Arthur remembers. And I use it for you, Arthur. Only for you. Only for him. Arthur can’t breath. He can hardly even think. Several emotions hit him at once: amazement, wonder, sheer gratefulness. Love. Arthur looks at Merlin and says, “Thank you.” And even though he’s said it a million times already, he thinks he’d have to say it again and again until the end of time to ever make it mean anything, because this ‒ Merlin’s devotion, his love ‒ is not something Arthur could ever deserve. He wants it anyways. He wants it with every selfish thump of his bleeding, beating heart. “You don’t need to say thank you,” Merlin says. A moment later, the blue light vanishes ‒ Arthur almost cries out, says no, bring it back ‒ and then the fire is back and it’s as if nothing ever happened. Arthur may believe it hadn’t if it weren’t for his racing heart or the warmth in Merlin’s eyes. Merlin smiles. “But you’re welcome.” You have bewitched me in body and soul, and I love, I love, I love you A week later, Arthur stands in the throne room, crown upon his head. The court has gathered, men and women decked out in their finery. It’s a gorgeous day, and the bright sun casts its rays through the glass and onto the floor and the walls, onto the dais where Arthur stands, waiting. There is a hushed sort of murmuring among those who stand on both sides of the aisle, where a ceremonial carpet has been laid down. Arthur might be inclined to listen if it weren’t for the way his heart is going wild, pounding in his ears. His palms sweat, his breathing is near labored, and it takes every bit of his noble-bred propriety to keep from shifting from foot to foot nervously. Finally, the doors swing open. Merlin walks inside. Arthur has only seen him look this anxious one time, and that was when Arthur was dying. He bites back a smile, tries his best to appear kingly and formal. And then Merlin starts to make his way down the aisle, and any urge to laugh slowly fades as Arthur takes in his appearance in full. He’d absolutely refused Arthur’s attempt to have him dress in robes ‒ “ I’m not a lord, you prat!” he’d snapped, blushing like a maiden ‒ and instead wears a pair of tailored black trousers and a blue tunic, not unlike Arthur’s own. He looks different. He looks lovely . And his expression shifts as he walks, as each careful step brings him closer to Arthur. The nervousness slips away, morphing into something deep and intense. He looks Arthur right in the eye as he walks, and Arthur looks right back. The murmuring has stopped. The only sounds are Merlin’s quiet steps and Arthur’s quickened breathing. He gets to the foot of the dais. He walks up the steps. His eyes do not leave Arthur’s. And Arthur watches, throat tight, breathing ragged, as Merlin kneels at his feet. And now it’s Arthur’s turn to speak, only he can’t. He can hardly tear his eyes from Merlin’s ‒ gods, those eyes ‒ much less open his mouth and force air out. Merlin smiles, just a little, but it’s enough to bring Arthur back to the moment, to remind him that he has a very important speech to give. He wills his gaze away, looking out at the court. “Today, we are gathered to celebrate a man who has spent nearly a decade as a loyal servant to Camelot.” Arthur’s voice shakes, just a little. And then he takes a deep breath, reminds himself that today is probably the singular most important day of Merlin’s life, reminds himself that Merlin deserves every ounce of respect and strength that Arthur would show any knight or lord. More, even. And when he speaks again, his words come out strong and true. “In my years as Prince, and now King of Camelot, I have been continually amazed by the loyalty, devotion, and humility shown by Merlin. He has sacrificed more for the sake of this kingdom than any man I know, and he did it all while harboring a gift that ‒ ” Arthur’s voice begins to crack. He fights it back, lifting his chin. “ ‒ that could have very well resulted in his execution. Such loyalty is only spoken of in the greatest of stories, yet I have witnessed it now, with my own eyes. “For his sheer devotion, as well as his talent in the realm of magic, Merlin will be rewarded with the title of Court Sorcerer.” He glances at Merlin, then, and feels a gust of emotion at the pure gratefulness, the pride, in his eyes. “In the coming years, I am certain he will provide invaluable counsel, and I look forward to working with him to protect Camelot and all her citizens.” Arthur steps forward, then, and makes a gesture with his right hand. A servant comes to his side, holding a crimson pillow, and Arthur gives her a grateful smile as he lifts up the pin that sits there. She steps back, and then it’s only Arthur and Merlin. The rest of the court seems to dissolve as the two men lock eyes. Arthur lifts the pin ‒ a beautiful silver dragon, inlaid with blue jewels ‒ with a shaking hand. He steps closer, resting a hand on Merlin’s shoulder. “Rise.” Merlin does, and he’s so close now, and he’s looking at Arthur as if he’s everything, and gods, Arthur thinks that he was wrong about the night in the banquet hall, when he’d thought that every moment with Merlin had led to his demonstration of magic in front of the court. No. It had led to this moment. Merlin standing in front of Arthur, eyes shining with so much love that Arthur thinks he might suffocate from the sheer strength of it. And Arthur. Fully recognizing and accepting him for who he is. After years of secrets, of lies and denial and longing and pain, they are here. Arthur reaches out and pins the dragon to Merlin’s tunic. He steps back, gesturing for Merlin to come stand beside him. “I present to you,” Arthur calls out, the words sounding for all the world like a battle cry, like a declaration of the utmost pride, “Merlin. Court Sorcerer of Camelot!” The crowd erupts with applause, and Arthur watches Merlin as he gazes out at them, mouth slightly open, eyes shining with unshed tears. And then he looks at Arthur and smiles and Arthur thinks: I love you. And he knows, somehow, that Merlin is thinking it, too. That night, Arthur goes to him. Merlin has his own chambers now, due to his new rank, but he’s yet to move any of his things, so Arthur knows he’ll still be in Gaius’s room. So, as the evening turns dark and heavy, the moon rising high in the sky, Arthur departs his chambers and walks, legs damn near trembling, through the castle. He makes it to Gaius’s and knocks on the door. Merlin is the one who answers. He’s still wearing his clothes from earlier, and Arthur spies the dragon still pinned to his tunic. His mouth parts slightly when he sees Arthur, as if surprised. A moment later, however, something in his eyes shifts, and Arthur knows that he’s realized why Arthur has come to him at such a late hour. He asks anyways. “Come to my chambers?” The words are so very soft and unsure and laced with no small amount of fear. Merlin’s eyes darken, just slightly, and Arthur can’t breath. A moment later, he nods. He steps outside, closing the door behind him. Arthur turns, clasps his shaking hands in front of him, and begins to walk. They’re silent as Arthur leads them through the castle, their footsteps the only thing to break the quiet castle air. They’ve spoken enough, Arthur thinks. Then they’re at Arthur’s chambers, and he’s struggling to get the door open, and he might feel embarrassed if he was able to think of anything coherent right now. “Let me,” Merlin says quietly. There’s a click then, and the door swings open on its own, and gods, Arthur’s never going to get used to the feeling he gets when Merlin does that, is he? Never . He steps inside, making his way towards the fireplace. It flickers softly, and he watches Merlin as he reaches out a hand and whispers that same incarnation ‒ “ baern” ‒ and the flames leap up, sudden and hot, casting bright orange and yellow light against the stone walls. Merlin turns towards him. He walks up to Arthur, and now that he’s close, Arthur can see that his hands are shaking, too. Each step brings him closer, closer. Arthur can’t take his eyes off of him, thinks he probably couldn’t look away if the castle started crumbling around them. When he’s close enough that Arthur could count his lashes, he pauses. Waiting, as always, to follow Arthur’s lead. He reaches out, removing the pin and walking over to the fireplace to set it on the mantle before returning to his spot. He gently takes the end of Merlin’s tunic, hears Merlin’s sharp intake of breath. He seems to know what Arthur wants instinctively ‒ hasn’t he always, though? ‒ and lifts up his arms. Arthur pulls the tunic off of him, feels a fresh swell of affection when Merlin emerges with his dark hair ruffled. His affection quickly transforms into something else entirely when Merlin reaches out to take the end of his tunic. Then it’s Arthur’s turn to lift his arms, and the shirt is being pulled over his head. He looks at Merlin, watches the flames dance across the pale plain of his chest, and fuck, Arthur is already breathing raggedly, already feeling dizzy. And Merlin is staring at him with eyes so dark, so filled with want . He breathes, “ Arthur, ” ‒ just like he did that evening ‒ and then Arthur makes a choked noise and pulls Merlin flush up against him. Their lips are inches apart, and even though Arthur’s heart is beating wild with need, he takes a moment to just breathe him in, placing his forehead on Merlin’s and exhaling shakily. “ Kiss me, ” Merlin whispers. And Arthur does. He places one hand on Merlin’s shoulder and the other on his jaw and presses his lips to Merlin’s, and Arthur feels a jolt of something like heaven shoot right through him the moment they touch. It’s chaste, at first, their lips moving together gently, and Arthur lets out a sigh at the feeling of Merlin’s mouth molding to his own. And then there’s the sweep of Merlin’s tongue against his lips, and Arthur opens his mouth and ‒ Holy gods, Arthur thinks, because Merlin’s tongue is brushing up against his, and it’s hot and wet and better than fucking anything Arthur has ever felt. He lets out a soft groan, and then he’s cupping Merlin’s jaw with both hands, moving in to press their bodies even closer together. And Merlin’s lips are soft and his tongue is perfect, but Arthur wants more, and before he even realizes he’s doing it, he’s pushing Merlin back, back, until his body hits the wall, and yes, that’s more like it. He tears his lips away from Merlin’s, pressing his mouth, his teeth to Merlin’s neck, and all he can think is finally, finally, finally. He bites softly just above Merlin’s pulse point, and then Merlin moans softly and gods, that’s enough to make Arthur’s mind go blank. “You have no idea,” Merlin whispers, hoarse, tilting his head to give Arthur better access as he kisses and sucks and bites his way down Merlin’s throat, “how many times I thought ‒ ah ‒ thought about this.” “Hm?” Arthur says, because he can’t think past the way Merlin is moving against him, the way he’s giving sharp, airy gasps. “Sometimes,” Merlin chokes out, “I’d see you ‒ after training or ‒ or even just ‒ sitting at your table and I wanted you to ‒ ” Arthur detaches himself from Merlin’s neck, lips drifting back up to hover over Merlin’s. His heartbeat is pounding in his ears and he stares at Merlin’s eyes, pupils blown so wide the blue is all but drowning in black, and fuck, he still can’t believe this is happening. “What did you want?” he asks, sounding wrecked already, and if this is how kissing Merlin makes him feel, Arthur has no idea how he’s going to make it through the night alive. “I wanted you,” Merlin says, “to push me up against the nearest wall and fuck me.&quot; Arthur presses his forehead against Merlin’s, closes his eyes and moans, and he knows that he’s never going to be able to unhear that, knows that Merlin’s voice as he said that ‒ low and dark and hot ‒ is going to live forever in his head. “Please,” Merlin whispers, then, and presses his body right up against Arthur’s, so that he can feel all of him. Arthur rushes forward, kissing him again, and Merlin’s making this noise in the back of his throat, and then Arthur is pulling him away from the wall and pushing him towards the bed. And it’s like a fever dream, almost, the way it all feels. This is happening, he thinks, over and over in his head, as he kicks off his shoes and gets onto the bed, watching as Merlin removes his own boots with trembling hands. After they’re off, Arthur leans back onto his pillows and pulls Merlin roughly into his lap. And then Merlin is straddling him, their hips aligning, the action making a jolt of pleasure shoot right through him. And then Arthur watches ‒ feels his heart stutter and fucking stop ‒ when Merlin throws his head back, eyes closing, and moans, long and deep. “ Fuck, Merlin,” Arthur says, hoarse. And Merlin, the cheeky bastard, has the gall to smirk, although Arthur can tell he’s just as affected, just as breathless and wild, by the way his chest heaves and his hands grip Arthur’s thighs. Then he opens his eyes, looks right at Arthur, and rolls his hips. And now it’s Arthur’s turn to moan, eyes slipping shut of their own accord, head turning to the side. He sucks in a deep breath, trying to pull himself together, but then Merlin does it again, and again, and again. He starts up a steady pace, and Arthur can’t breath, he can’t breath. Literally. “ Breath, Arthur,” he hears Merlin say, and Arthur knows that Merlin is smirking without having to look. “Shut up, Merlin,” he hisses, “and just ‒ oh, gods, yes.” He opens his eyes, then, and the sight of Merlin on top of him, chest glistening with sweat, eyes glazed over with pleasure, is like something out of a dream, and he still can’t believe this is happening, still can’t believe that it’s Merlin making him feel this way. “Merlin,” he breathes, and then Merlin is bending down, hovering over him, hips still going. He looks Arthur in the eye, touching a hand to Arthur’s cheek, stroking it gently. “I’m not going to last,” he admits, cheeks burning. Merlin doesn’t laugh, though. He moves even faster, now, and moans softly before leaning down, lips right up against Arthur’s ear, and murmuring, “Whatever you want, Arthur. I’ll do whatever you want.” And gods, Arthur’s not going to lie ‒ watching Merlin act like this, seeing his blissed out expression as he tells Arthur he can have him in any way he wants ‒ feels fucking good. But Merlin has spent years and years following Arthur, has done whatever he wants for nearly a decade. He decides, right then and there, that he wants Merlin to decide what he wants, wants Merlin to be the one who’s leading tonight. So, Arthur reaches up, presses his hand to Merlin’s cheek and breathes, “ Tell me. ” And Merlin, as he always does, understands. His eyes go even darker, somehow, and then he abruptly stills his hips. And Arthur is about to whine ‒ gods, probably literally whine ‒ in complaint when Merlin leans down once more, presses his forehead to Arthur’s and whispers, “I want you inside me.” Arthur’s heart stops. His entire body goes tight, and a wave of heat washes over him, because gods, even the thought of that is enough to make him feel completely wrecked. And Merlin misunderstands, pulls away a bit and says, unsure, “You don’t ‒ you don’t have to, if you don’t want ‒ ” A moment later, Arthur has them flipped over. He hovers over Merlin and bites back a smile at the shocked expression on Merlin’s face. He leans in. Puts his lips by Merlin’s ear. “I want to,” he says. Merlin lets his head fall back against the pillow, eyes squeezing shut. “Good,” he chokes out, and if Arthur might’ve laughed if he weren’t shaking and sweating and thinking fuck, I’m going to do this, we’re actually going to do this. Arthur has never wanted anything more in his life. He also has no idea what he’s doing. He sits up for a moment, rising from where he’d been resting his elbows on either side of Merlin’s body, breathing heavily and trying to figure out what to say. His mind is already a whirl of incoherence, and he can barely string five words together, much less admit that he’s clueless when it comes to doing this with another man. Merlin stares up at him, frowning slightly, and damn it, Arthur doesn’t want that. So, he turns his head away, face burning, and says lowly, “I ‒ um ‒ I’m not sure how to ‒ ” he breaks off, running a hand through his hair, and gives Merlin a meaningful look. Merlin’s uncertainty morphs into sweet understanding, and he nods. “I’ll show you,” he says. And he does. He shows Arthur what to use and how to use it, retrieving a vial of oil from Arthur’s bedside table ‒ usually used for aches and pains after a hard day’s training, and Arthur briefly thinks that he’s never going to be able to look at it the same way after this ‒ and a few minutes later, Merlin is under him and Arthur is on top, and they’re stripped of their trousers and smallclothes, and suddenly Arthur feels as though he’s fucking frozen. Merlin is breathing hard and ragged already, face flushed from when he’d shown Arthur how to work him open, and every sound makes Arthur’s body more and more tense, makes him feel as though he’s pulled tight like a bowstring. His heartbeat is going fast, so fast, pounding in his ears, and Merlin just waits, not saying anything, somehow sensing that Arthur needs a moment to gather himself. Arthur sucks in a deep breath, trembling, and pushes in. He goes slowly, inch by inch, Merlin gasping underneath him, and Arthur can’t believe this, he can’t believe this. He watches Merlin’s face as he bottoms out, watches those dark blue eyes widen slightly, watches his mouth part and watches him tremble, and Arthur thinks that he needs this every day for the rest of his life or he’ll die. Merlin. His best friend. His right hand. His protector and his other half. Arthur pulls out, gasping, and pushes back in. Merlin lets out a high, keening moan, and Arthur has never once in his life felt like this, every piece of him drowning in the way Merlin feels around him. He rocks his hips, slow at first, each movement sending a shockwave of pleasure right through him. Memories flash through his mind, images and words and feelings. “I could take you apart with one blow.” A slow smirk and ‒ “ I could take you apart with less than that.” He moves faster, and Merlin’s breath hitches, hands reaching up to grasp Arthur’s shoulders and squeezing tight. A crackling fireplace, and Merlin’s wrapped up in a blanket, still shivering from the aftereffects of the poison. He tells Arthur, “Thank you,” and Arthur can only gaze back in surprise ‒ in fondness ‒ at the gratitude, in Merlin’s eyes. “Get some rest.” Merlin is shaking underneath him, now, is letting out these fucking beautiful noises, and gods, Arthur feels like his entire body is on fire. “Good to see you, Merlin,” Arthur says, reaching forward to grab Merlin’s shoulder and squeeze gently, even though every single fiber of his being is saying just hug him, idiot. “Good to see you, too,” Merlin says, so sweetly, and Arthur’s heart clenches, a wave of pure warmth sweeping right through him. Arthur collapses forward, leaning down to press his elbows onto the bed, bracketing Merlin’s body in his arms. “Arthur,” Merlin groans, the change of angle making his whole body tighten, chest heaving. And then Arthur shifts slightly, and suddenly Merlin lets out a sharp cry, almost pained, and Arthur immediately stills. “Merlin?” he asks, breathless. “Are you ‒ ” “No, Arthur, Arthur ‒ ” The way Merlin says his name is reverent, and Arthur actually fucking blushes. “Do that ‒ do that again, please, please.&quot; He thrusts once and Merlin throws his head back, jaw going slack with pleasure. “Oh gods, ” he moans, and then Arthur is moving again, rocking into him over and over just to hear that sound. Merlin’s voice is filled with such surety, such faith. “I’m going to make you see that Tristan’s wrong. You aren’t just anyone. You are special. You and you alone can draw out that sword.” And Arthur does, and Merlin is there with him, standing by him, looking at Arthur with eyes that are bright with pride. Pride and ‒ Arthur’s body tightens, shaking, and he knows he’s getting close, knows that Merlin is too. They move together, gasping, and Arthur lifts himself up, pulling away so he can place a hand on Merlin’s cheek. They lock eyes. Arthur says, breathless, lit up, on fire ‒ “I love you,” and then Merlin is arching his back, crying out, and Arthur follows a moment later, mouth dropping open, soundless with pleasure as he peaks. And he&#x27;s thinking that this, this is heaven, thinks that there is no eternal paradise, no anything that could compare. ‒ love. The night goes on, but neither man sleeps. Arthur leans back against his pillows, Merlin huddled into his chest. He plays with Merlin’s dark hair, running his fingers through the short strands and staring up at the canopy with a soft smile. Merlin looks at him, then, tilting his chin up to gaze at him lovingly. “I think,” he begins, in that cheeky voice, and Arthur just knows he’s about to be embarrassed, “you’ve been smiling for the past two hours.” Arthur ought to tug at his hair or say shut up, Merlin, but instead he just shrugs and admits, cheeks burning ‒ “I’m happy.” And gods, Merlin just outright melts, and Arthur makes a mental note to occasionally ‒ only occasionally ‒ make a few sappy comments in the future if it’ll make Merlin look at him like that. “Me, too,” he says, burying his face in Arthur’s chest once more. There’s a comfortable silence, and then, a few minutes later ‒ “I love you, too.” Arthur just pulls Merlin closer, dropping a kiss onto his head. Three little words. Said a million times, probably, over the course of history. And it’s such a simple statement, really. Only for Arthur, it was hardly simple at all. Ten years. Ten years of friendship and longing, of desire and of love, all hidden away. All kept trapped inside an aching heart, under layers of fear and self-loathing and guilt. But Arthur looks at Merlin, then, watching as he slowly falls asleep, as eyes fall shut and his breathing evens out, and thinks: we got there, in the end. Arthur loves Merlin. Merlin loves Arthur. This is the ending they get, after all the hell they’ve been through. This is the ending they deserve.</span> <a href="#" class="summary-toggle">[ + ]</a></div><div class="stats"><div class="stat-item"><strong>Rating:</strong> Mature</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Archive Warning:</strong> Creator Chose Not To Use Archive Warnings</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Category:</strong> F/M, M/M</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Fandom:</strong> Merlin (TV)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Relationship:</strong> Merlin/Arthur Pendragon (Merlin), Gwen/Arthur Pendragon (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Character:</strong> Merlin (Merlin), Arthur Pendragon (Merlin), Gwen (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Additional Tags:</strong> Alternate Universe - Canon Divergence, Post-Episode: s05e13 The Diamond of the Day, Post-Season/Series 05, Unresolved Sexual Tension, Pining Arthur, Guilty Arthur, Mutual Pining, Emotional Infidelity, Angst, Angst with a Happy Ending, repressed arthur, Internalized Homophobia, First Time, First Kiss</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Language:</strong> English</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Published:</strong> 2020-08-26</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Words:</strong> 37, 459</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Chapters:</strong> 1/1</div></div></div><div class="work-entry"><h2 class="title"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://download.archiveofourown.org/downloads/1581461/Im%20Never%20Giving%20Up%20on.pdf?updated_at=1600648464" target="_blank">I&#x27;m Never Giving Up on You</a></h2><div class="summary">Arthur has slipped away and Merlin isn’t ready to let him go.</div><div class="stats"><div class="stat-item"><strong>Rating:</strong> Teen And Up Audiences</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Archive Warning:</strong> Major Character Death</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Category:</strong> M/M</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Fandom:</strong> Merlin (TV)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Relationship:</strong> Merlin/Arthur Pendragon (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Character:</strong> Merlin (Merlin), Arthur Pendragon (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Additional Tags:</strong> Angst, Canon Era, Canonical Character Death, 5x13, Post-Episode: s05e13 The Diamond of the Day, Episode: s05e13 The Diamond of the Day</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Series:</strong> Part 34 of Merlin Episodes: AUs, Missing Scenes, and Inspired By</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Collections:</strong> Camelot Drabble -- Prompt #107: Song Prompt &quot;Say Something&quot; by A Great Big World</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Published:</strong> 2014-05-07</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Words:</strong> 926</div></div></div><div class="work-entry"><h2 class="title"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://download.archiveofourown.org/downloads/35996359/In%20Exchange%20For%20Your.pdf?updated_at=1646840144" target="_blank">In Exchange For Your Heart</a></h2><div class="summary"><span class="summary-short">Dark!fic The Kingdom of Avalon has fallen.

The only problem is that Arthur is in love with Guinevere. Arthur is head over heels in love with Merlin but is convinced the warlock is in love with Morgana, so Arthur is dating Guinevere to make them jealous. Merlin and Morgana aren’t in love, they just tend to pretend to make out to hide that they’re practicing magic together in secret Basically a fake dating au where both Merlin and Arthur are idiots (hence the &quot;the love is requited, they&#x27;re just idiots&quot; tag) Notes See the end of the work for notes There was a knock at the door of Arthur’s chambers. “Enter,” Arthur said, not looking up from his reading. Merlin glanced up at the door from where he was grabbing Arthur’s riding clothes. Gwen entered the room, head held high. “Your Highness,” Gwen said. “The Lady Morgana would like to coordinate outfits with you for the upcoming feast tomorrow.” Merlin looked up at Gwen, the blood draining from his face. He would undoubtedly have to help with all the last minute preparations of said feast. Gwen gave him a sympathetic smile. At least they would be working together. “What possessed Morgana to do that?” Arthur asked, putting down his scroll. “What color was she thinking?” “Emerald green, Your Highness,” Gwen said, curtseying. Arthur’s lip curled in disgust. “Of course she chose green,” he muttered. “Alright. Tell Morgana that that is acceptable. Have Merlin help you with the arrangements.” Merlin looked at Gwen, biting back a groan. “Yes, Your Highness,” Gwen replied with a curtsey before leaving the room. Merlin put down Arthur’s riding clothes and followed after her. If Arthur complained, he only had himself to blame. “So what does this all entail?” Merlin asked. “We find Arthur an outfit in emerald that matches Lady Morgana’s dress.” “That would be easier if Arthur wore anything that wasn’t red,” Merlin grumbled. Gwen laughed as they strode down the halls. “Luckily the tailors already know Arthur’s measurements, it won’t be hard to have something made quickly.” “Is anything quick and easy when it comes to Arthur?” Merlin asked, raising an eyebrow. Gwen laughed again, inclining her head towards Merlin. “Good point. He does have some charming features to him, though.” Merlin’s stomach twisted. A sudden annoyance toward Gwen arose in his chest but he quashed it down. He didn’t want to feel ill will towards her, but it still sat there like a curled dragon, waiting to catch him off guard again. Likely that night when sleep eluded him. “Right,” Merlin muttered under his breath, quiet enough that he thought Gwen wouldn’t hear. Gwen tilted her head and studied him before deciding to pretend she hadn’t heard. Gwen and Merlin passed hurried servants with arms full of decorations and cleaning supplies. “We might also have to help prepare for the feast itself. I will, at least, since Morgana already has a dress.” “I can help. It’ll get me away from Arthur for a while and I’ll be of use for something other than target practice.” Gwen gave a small snort of laughter. “Sorry,” she mumbled. “It’s alright, everyone knows how much of a royal prat Arthur is. I would expect nothing less.” Gwen smiled and shook her head before knocking at the tailor’s door. Entering the room, she said, “Prince Arthur needs a formal outfit for the feast tomorrow.” The tailor nodded wearily. “The usual red?” “No, he’ll be coordinating with Lady Morgana. Emerald green.” “I’ll see what I can do,” the tailor said. “Sorry,” Merlin said. The tailor gave Merlin a weak smile, the bags under his eyes weighing down his entire frame with exhaustion. “Is there something wrong?” Gwen asked, resting a hand on the tailor’s arm. “You seem more exhausted and harried than usual.” “The Lady Morgana convinced King Uther to reinstate the servants’ ball, so I’m working overtime to make items for the servants as well.” “I’m sorry,” Gwen said. “What’s the servants’ ball?” Merlin asked. “It’s a celebration for the servants after the regular feasting activities. A ‘thank you’ of sorts for all the hard work the servants do,” Gwen explained. Merlin nodded. “Is it required?” “Not necessarily, but there will be better food than you get otherwise and I’m requiring you to come with me. We’ll coordinate outfits. I’m thinking a nice blue.” Merlin smiled. “Well then I guess you’re in luck because blue’s my favorite color.” “I’m glad, because I embroidered you a cloak, so there’s no backing out now.” Merlin blanched. “A cloak?” Gwen nodded. “It has stars on it, just wait until you see it.” “This feast was announced today, when did you have the time to make me a cloak?” Gwen shrugged. “A girl gets bored, you know. Besides, I thought it would make a nice Yule gift.” “How did you know my measurements?” Gwen smiled, a mischievous twinkle in her eye. “A girl’s got to have her secrets, Merlin.” Merlin backed away slowly with wide eyes. Gwen laughed. “While you were out helping Arthur, I talked to Gaius. He let me into your room to get the measurements.” Merlin nodded despite his unease. What if she had seen his magic book? “Well, let’s leave the tailor to his work, there’s more to be done,” Gwen said. Merlin wordlessly followed her out and back into the bustling halls. “Do you have a dress for the servants’ ball?” Merlin asked. “I do. Lady Morgana gave it to me as a gift. It’s what inspired me to make your cloak.” “I’m flattered you made me a cloak,” Merlin said. “Of course,” Gwen said, hip checking Merlin. “We’re friends, that’s what friends do.” Merlin laughed. “Guess I better learn to sew, then,” he joked. “That’s unnecessary, but you could help me pick wildflowers to put around the castle,” Gwen said. Merlin nodded. “Sure.” “But for now, we have feast preparations and masters to tend to.” They strode down the halls quickly, Gwen rushing to a servant overburdened with boxes, grabbing the other side of the box. “Well, let’s get to work then,” Merlin said to himself, pushing up his sleeves. He lost Gwen in the commotion but he’d find her eventually. The feast, which was in full swing by then, was a boisterous affair. The bubbling anticipation of the servants’ ball was the only thing keeping all the servants awake as the party went on through the night. Morgana was certainly right, in emerald green, she and Arthur were a stunning picture of elegance and rivaled every other person at the party, even the dignitaries from the neighboring kingdom who had decided to descend upon Camelot so suddenly. But Arthur didn’t have eyes for Morgana. He kept looking over at where Merlin and Guinevere stood together, stunning visions in midnight blue, the lights of the candles catching on the gold and silver embroidered stars on their outfits. Merlin studied Arthur out of the corner of his eyes. Arthur’s gaze kept flitting to him and Gwen. He’s probably swooning over Gwen, Merlin thought bitterly as he filled goblets with wine. As the feasting ended, the band struck up a tune and the dancing began. Merlin watched the glittering nobles and their celebration, not able to do anything more than hold a wine pitcher and maybe shuffle his feet. Gwen bumped shoulders with him. “Cheer up, we’ll be dancing ourselves in a few hours.” “The food better be worth it,” Merlin grumbled. “It will be.” Eventually, the feast wound down and the nobles departed. Merlin helped Arthur undress and retire for the night, not bothering to take off his cloak. It was comfortable and smelled faintly of wildflowers. “Good night, Merlin,” Arthur said as Merlin snuffed out the candles. “Good night,” Merlin said, already on his way out the door. “That cloak suits you.” Merlin stopped, hand resting on the door handle. What was he supposed to say? “Thank you,” Merlin said before closing the door and walking away. He followed the groups of servants crackling with nervous excitement. They obviously knew the way. The less he had to think about where he was walking, the more he could ruminate on what Arthur had said. “Merlin,” Gwen said. He stopped walking, looking around. She popped up at his elbow, linking arms with him. “We have to make our grand entrance together.” Merlin nodded and let Gwen lead him through the castle. The servants’ ball wasn’t like the balls and feasts he was used to. It had the same food, cast offs and leftovers from the feast earlier in the evening, and everyone was dressed in their best, but there weren’t silver plates and a professional band, it was wooden trenchers and the cook had brought her harp. “We’re the best dressed here,” Merlin joked. “Of course we are, isn’t that the point?” Gwen and Merlin exchanged a grin. Gwen opened her hand to Merlin. “Shall we?” Merlin took her hand and let her lead him to the dance floor. They danced, Merlin letting Gwen lead, since she knew more about dancing than he did. They swirled through the dance floor much like Arthur and Morgana had earlier but a starry vision.

He is disappointed that he will miss the festivities, frustrated because Merlin is telling him what to do, and feels awful because every bone in his body aches. Through it all, Merlin, ever the faithful servant, takes very good care of Arthur. Notes Disclaimer : Merlin characters are the property of Shine and BBC.

A thousand thank yous to the wonderful mods for running this most festive of fests once again, and hugs and kisses to my always magnificent beta. Merlin stepped into the much too quiet room and softly closed the door behind him with his foot. He was careful not to trip over the basketful of freshly laundered clothing he had left by the door earlier. Normally, this wouldn’t be a problem. With the exception of when Arthur slept, his chambers were bathed in daylight or candlelight, and Merlin rarely spent time in Arthur’s chambers in the dark of night. This night, however, was not at all a normal one for the king of Camelot or his manservant. The usually filled-to-the-brim-with-energy Arthur Pendragon had come down with a nasty cold, and his boundless vigour had been replaced with lethargy and incessant whinging. Merlin had been subjected to the latter non-stop all day (thank goodness the king had finally fallen asleep and given Merlin a respite.) Arthur’s initial complaint had been how he didn’t want to be sick (who did?) Second, it had been how much everyone else would miss his presence at the council meeting (as if there was no one else who could report on the goings-on of Camelot and its surrounding areas.) Merlin had listened like the good servant he was and hadn’t responded with his usual snippity comebacks, but only because it was blatantly clear that Arthur felt awful. Merlin was all for giving as good as he got, but not in this situation. He didn’t at all like seeing Arthur sick; he felt protective and wanted to make it all better, especially when the king complained that his head throbbed, his nose hurt from sneezing and blowing it, and his entire body ached. Merlin hadn’t mentioned it, but as Arthur had talked (with great difficulty) his chest rattled. Gaius, after checking over Arthur and plying him with various medicinal concoctions, had taken Merlin aside and told him that, while the king’s prognosis was for a complete recovery, he was quite ill and Merlin would need to keep a close eye on him. And that was why the room was in almost complete darkness. The only light came from the full moon, which, while bright and helpful to those out in the open with no walls or ceilings to block its view, only helped so much by the time it reached Arthur’s chambers – but Merlin carefully made his way to the bed, opened the bed curtains, set down the tray on the bedside table, and checked Arthur’s temperature by placing his hand on Arthur’s forehead, which was far too warm. At least he was still sleeping, which his body needed to recover, but his breathing was somewhat more laboured than it had been before, and his skin was pale and clammy with perspiration. Merlin sat on the edge of the bed and ran his other hand through Arthur’s dampened fringe. The king mumbled something that sounded like Merlin (or was Merlin merely hearing what he wanted to?) in his sleep but didn’t wake, which was most definitely a good thing; it was too late to deal with cranky kings, no matter how sweet and innocent they looked while they slept. Sweet and innocent… Merlin almost laughed. He instead grimaced as Arthur’s forehead creased and his facial muscles moved ever so slightly. Merlin didn’t like to see Arthur, ruler of Camelot, defending champion of every contest over the past four years, the one who had been trained from birth to kill, and pompous prat extraordinaire, like this. Especially at this time of year. As Merlin knew all too well from his years with Arthur, the castle was busy year-round and there were celebrations throughout for various reasons, but it was Yule that Arthur looked forward to the most. This was the only time of year the king allowed himself to truly enjoy himself. He had long ago shared with Merlin that, as a child, his father had always taken the time to go wassailing with him. No matter how busy he had been, and no matter how much his time was taken up devoted to all the things that a king had to do on a daily basis, he had made a point of spending at least a day with his son where, unless it was a matter of life or death, he was not to be interrupted. Arthur had shared many a story about these special outings. Merlin grinned at the memory of Arthur’s face when he had relayed these memories of happier and innocent times, but the grin slipped when the past again morphed into the present. Arthur had been given strict orders to remain in bed for a week, but Merlin hadn’t been born yesterday. He knew the king would attempt to do whatever it took to go about his duties as normal. What is a little sickness ? he would probably say. I am the king, Merlin. You can’t tell me what to do , he would most definitely add when Merlin protested. Merlin didn’t see how he could logistically keep Arthur in bed for seven days. It was an impossible ask. There were only so many stories Merlin could regale Arthur with. No matter how enthralling tales of Ealdor might be, and no matter how much Arthur seemed to enjoy them and ask for more, they would not keep the king of Camelot in bed for a week! Barring Arthur’s legs giving out on him, there was not a chance in Hades that he would allow Yule to pass him by without participating. But Merlin would do the best he could. He had a prophecy to see through to the end, after all. It would not at all do for Arthur to die before he and Merlin fulfilled Kilgharrah’s esoteric musings. Just how he was to keep Arthur immobile, however, eluded him. Already, the king had pouted endlessly that his subjects expected to see him, that he couldn’t allow a little cold to keep him down. He had complained endlessly that Gaius and Merlin had no authority over him. But not once had he followed these protestations with attempts to get out of bed and carry on with his duties. And certainly someone who did not feel like death warmed over, who was bound and determined to have their way, would most definitely have at least endeavoured to do this, at least that was Merlin’s thought on the matter. Arthur had merely grumbled and promised that when he got better, he would find another manservant to take Merlin’s place. Through all of this, Merlin had nodded and told Arthur that was all fine and good, and that he would take his leave and return to Ealdor like a good little servant when that time came, but until he was sacked, he would make sure his king recovered. Arthur had glared, but, really, what else could he do since he obviously wasn’t in any position to prove his manservant and court physician wrong? When Gaius had last come to check on Arthur, he had told Merlin he deserved a knighthood for putting up with Arthur’s histrionics. Arthur hadn’t appreciated that at all and had threatened to not only sack Merlin, but Gaius as well. And then he had sneezed four times in succession and fallen back on his pillow in frustration as Gaius assured him that this, too, would pass. Merlin could still see the glare Arthur had given them. If looks could kill… “Merlin, is that you?” croaked Arthur, opening his eyes but almost immediately closing them again. “Ugh, I thought Gaius said I would get better, but I feel terrible.” Merlin reluctantly removed his hand from where it was settled on Arthur’s forehead and rested it on his lap. “It’s only been a day, Arthur. These things take time to run their course.” Arthur’s exasperated grunt very nearly had Merlin chuckling. He didn’t, but only because he was reminded of a time not too far in the past when he himself had been sick with a bad cold and had complained endlessly to Gaius. If sick people couldn’t complain, what fun was that? “I can’t believe I had to get sick now. It is the worst timing,” Arthur groused before he coughed. “Have you talked to Leon about representing me at the Yule celebrations? He assisted my father and will know what needs doing.” Arthur sneezed and groaned. “Make it stooooop,” he whinged. Merlin felt for Arthur; he knew what it was like to be sick and have no energy and to feel like death. Or to feel as if death would be preferable. “I have, and Leon has assured me that he has it all under control, sire. You are not to worry yourself with these matters,” he added, knowing as he spoke them he would get the evil eye, which he did. “Not my words. Leon’s,” he added. Arthur closed his eyes and scrunched up his forehead as he made a pained noise. “Can you do that thing you did before you left earlier? It seems the only thing that helps,” Arthur said softly as he squeezed his eyes tighter. “You w- want me to rub your temples for you?” Merlin asked as he pinched the bridge of his nose and let out a small sigh. This request was one he would rather refuse. Not because he didn’t want to help Arthur. He did. Very much so. But this was too much. Too intimate. Too evocative. Too much a reminder of what Merlin wanted but would never have. “Just like you did this morning,” Arthur added slowly as he opened his eyes. “You also rubbed my shoulders and arms to help with the achiness.” His sad eyes pled with Merlin to say yes. How was Merlin to say no to that? He nodded sadly, reminded of how sickness changed a person. That Arthur Pendragon, King of Camelot, was willingly asking his manservant, whom he called idiot on a regular basis, to massage him was surreal. If only Arthur weren’t asking because he was sick. But he was and there was no getting around that. Merlin wished he could say no, but he wouldn’t. It wasn’t the king’s fault that his manservant had gone and fallen in love or lust or deep like with Arthur. The king had no idea that his request hurt Merlin. But this was his own fault. Really, it was. Silly, stupid Merlin , Merlin repeated beneath his breath. If only he hadn’t been cheeky earlier. Yes, just as Arthur said, Merlin had helped Arthur feel better earlier by massaging him, but his actions had been the result of him threatening to settle in the bed beside Arthur if he complained one more time about his bothersome manservant taking care of him. It had been a joke. Well, obviously, Arthur had complained, so really Merlin hadn’t had a choice, had he? His mum had told him long ago that if you said you were going to do something, it was only right that you followed through. If you didn’t, your word most likely wouldn’t be given serious consideration in the future. Arthur had protested mightily, but once Merlin joined him under the covers and began stroking Arthur’s hair and massaging his temples, shoulders, and arms, he had closed his eyes and fallen asleep. Merlin grinned at the memory. He had intended to get up and leave as soon as Arthur was asleep, but when he’d tried, Arthur made a sound of protest, so Merlin had waited a while before he got up and went to check on Gaius and to see if the court physician needed any help. Nothing else for it, Merlin toed off his boots and removed his kerchief before climbing into the bed and settling beside Arthur. Arthur immediately turned towards him and smiled as he closed his eyes and burrowed into his manservant. Merlin stroked Arthur’s hair for some time before he moved his fingers to his temples. As he began to massage them he whispered words of magic that he hoped would help hasten Arthur’s recovery. “I already feel better,” Arthur whispered sometime later as one of his hands reached over and grasped Merlin’s. “Thank you.” Merlin nodded, but of course Arthur couldn’t see. Merlin briefly contemplated getting up and acting a little more like a proper manservant should – he needed to put away the laundered clothes and tidy Arthur’s chambers, but as it was dark, he wouldn’t be able to. And he was tired. He was in a comfortable, warm bed. Who was he to question it? So he closed his eyes and fell asleep. When he next woke, he felt something pressing against him and was momentarily frightened until he remembered where he was and that he had fallen asleep next to Arthur. He opened his eyes and was startled to see that he and Arthur were now practically sleeping in each other’s arms. How had that happened? He attempted to extricate himself but Arthur, who Merlin only now realised was awake – a moonbeam lit his pale face and gave the already ill king an ethereal aura – was having none of it. He pulled Merlin towards him. Merlin opened his mouth to protest but Arthur beat him to it. “You can’t leave. I am starting to feel better. As your king, I am asking you to stay here with me.” Merlin rolled his eyes. “Erm, is that a command or are you still feeling so bad that you do not know what you are saying?” Arthur chuckled. “The latter, no doubt, but please don’t go,” he asked, sounding pathetic and looking adorable. Merlin settled back down and closed his eyes as Arthur burrowed into him once again. The next time Merlin awoke, Arthur was sneezing. It took a few seconds for Merlin’s eyes to acclimate to the darkness, but the small sliver of moonlight allowed him to see that Arthur looked miserable as he blew his nose and leant his head against the headboard, where he was now seated. He was probably trying to breathe easier. Merlin briefly wondered if he would get sick as a result of being so close to Arthur, but if he did, he did. It was too late to worry about that now. “It should be time for you to take another potion. How is your head?” he asked as he pushed himself up so he was sitting. He reached over and felt Arthur’s head and was only a tiny bit surprised when there was no protesting. “I think your temperature has risen,” he said, studying Arthur’s pale face and thinking Arthur could do with a cold bath. But Arthur would not want to move, and as it was not dire at this time, Merlin decided to let it go for now and try to get Arthur to go back to sleep. He would worry about getting Arthur to bathe and cool down later. “Better, but every bone in my body hurts,” Arthur replied as he closed his eyes and made a pitiful sound reminiscent to the noises the puppies Arthur’s dog had recently given birth to made. It hurt Merlin to see and hear Arthur like this and he wanted to take away this pain. He had tried to do as much as he dared. There was more he could attempt, but as Merlin retrieved a potion for Arthur he wasn’t convinced that death was a proper reward for his efforts. “Tell me a story about you, your mum, and Will going wassailing,” Arthur said as he accepted the phial and downed the contents. He handed the phial back to Merlin. “I guess this will make me sleep again,” he mumbled as he settled himself back beneath the covers and closed his eyes. “You can stop when I go to sleep.” “Aye, aye, sire,” Merlin whispered before clearing his throat and settling himself beside Arthur and getting comfortable. “I think last time I regaled you with the year Old Man Simmons nearly died during our wassailing trip when I was in my thirteenth year,” he began as he massaged Arthur’s shoulders and remembered the evasive comments he’d given when Arthur asked what an old man was doing felling an oak. That was definitely a story for another day… and time. Far, far in the future. “I think maybe you’ll get a good laugh out of this one.” Merlin chuckled, knowing that Arthur loved hearing stories where his manservant found himself in difficult situations, but when Arthur opened his eyes and smiled, his eyes still looking sad, but with a tinge of warmth (yes, Merlin was aware that he was probably making all of this up in his mind and that these looks meant nothing more than someone who was sick being thankful for someone taking care of them), Merlin thought his heart was doing flips. He could only hope he wasn’t blushing. He was so close to Arthur. So. Very. Close. All he had to do was lean in and press his lips to Arthur’s. And he wanted to so very badly. He’d wanted to for almost a year. But now wasn’t the time. Probably never would be the time, but certainly not now. Merlin took a deep, calming breath when Arthur finally closed his eyes and moved his hands to Arthur’s arms. He began massaging them as he willed his heart to return to normal, not trusting himself to speak quite yet. “When I was eight, Will and me got hold of my mother’s wassail that she made for the adults. She always made two batches: one for the children and one for the adults. I have no idea what we were thinking,” he said, but he laughed as soon as he said it. “Okay, yeah, so we probably wanted to see what it was about this drink that made the adults laugh so much. Anyway, we made ourselves so sick that we were unable to participate in that year’s wassailing. Well, I should add that my mum punished me by telling me I couldn’t go, but Will and me did get sick so I couldn’t have gone anyway. I cried and cried, but my mother was having none of it. As you’ve seen, she has a heart of gold, but let me tell you that she only had to look at me when I’d done something wrong and I was done for. I didn’t get in trouble much because I was, as Will called me, the perfect little angel most of the time, but when I got a wild hair I could be as rotten as Will.” Arthur laughed, or attempted to. It was more like a grunt followed by a fit of coughs, and his face morphed into another grimace. Merlin’s mouth murmured shhh , but of course Arthur couldn’t see. “When everyone else got back from wassailing, Will and me were still crying. Mum wasn’t much fussed about it – she never backed down from her punishments – but Old Man Simmons snuck us a few wassail-soaked cakes, erm, not the ones for the adults,” he added, anticipating Arthur asking, “and told us what we missed.” Arthur began snoring, but Merlin didn’t stop his ministrations, hoping that in some small way he was helping Arthur get better. Yes, he knew that the potions were what would end up making Arthur better, but as both his mother and Gaius had shared with him, Merlin knew that caring for and tending a sick person did their part. His mother had once shared with him that one should never discount the impact another person’s bedside manner could have on someone who was ill. He lifted his head, leaned over, and kissed Arthur on the forehead. He would do anything to help Arthur, but he doubted the king of Camelot had an inkling of that. And that was the way it would remain. At least for now. Perhaps one day things would change and these grandiose ideas of his would become reality, but for now Merlin wouldn’t entertain such thoughts. Allowing himself to do so would merely exacerbate the hurt that came with his current reality. And his current reality was that he had a king to keep alive. At all costs. He settled his head back on the pillow, turned towards a snoring Arthur, and settled in for what he hoped would be a good night’s sleep. “I love you, Arthur Pendragon,” Merlin whispered as he touched his finger to his lips, kissed it, and pressed it to Arthur’s chapped lips before closing his eyes.</span> <a href="#" class="summary-toggle">[ + ]</a></div><div class="stats"><div class="stat-item"><strong>Rating:</strong> Teen And Up Audiences</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Archive Warning:</strong> No Archive Warnings Apply</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Category:</strong> M/M</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Fandom:</strong> Merlin (TV)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Relationship:</strong> Merlin/Arthur Pendragon (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Character:</strong> Merlin (Merlin), Arthur Pendragon (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Additional Tags:</strong> Alternate Universe - Canon Divergence, Sick Arthur, Merlin takes care of Arthur, Yule, Hurt/Comfort, Protective Merlin, Sharing a Bed, Fluff</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Collections:</strong> WinterKnights 2019 - a Merlin Winter/Holiday Fest</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Published:</strong> 2020-01-11</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Words:</strong> 3418</div></div></div><div class="work-entry"><h2 class="title"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://download.archiveofourown.org/downloads/17091572/Light%20the%20Log.pdf?updated_at=1545385846" target="_blank">Light the Log!</a></h2><div class="summary"><span class="summary-short">Lighting the Yule Log is taking too long, according to Merlin.

Notes A one shot with Arthur and an OC surrounding the lighting of the Yule Log and sharing cloaks. Honestly, pure fluff and cute moments. Happy solstice, everyone! Disclaimer: I do not own the Merlin characters, but I do own Mia. “It’s bloody chilly in here.” Merlin states as he appears at Arthur’s side, stamping his feet lightly against the stone floor, “Can we light the thing already?!” “No, Merlin,” Arthur drawls, dropping all aspects of his kingly status in the private moment, “We cannot light the Yule Log yet, as it is not time.” “But it’s cold!” “We’re all cold.” Merlin lets out a scoff, his eyes dropping down quickly to survey Arthur’s heavy cloak draped across the blonde man’s shoulders, “Yes, I’m sure you are especially cold under that. What is it again, wool?” “Shut up, Merlin.” “And anyways,” The manservant sniffs, tucking his hands further under his threadbare jacket, “I was more concerned about someone else.” “You mean you were thinking of someone besides yourself?” Arthur gasps in mocking, “Maybe wishes do come true!” “Prat.” The king’s lips twitch into a smirk as his shoulder bumps into that of his manservant’s, “Alright, Merlin, entertain me. Who is it you were thinking of?” “Mia.” Arthur’s eyes dart across the room, easily landing on the body of the name uttered by Merlin. He’d been well aware of the maidservants location in the Great Hall since the moment she’d walked through the doors, even as she moved around to various small groups, talking quietly with whomever she knew. But Arthur had also been trying his best to not be obvious about his awareness of the woman, since he was meant to be the king in this setting, instead of just Arthur. Blue meets green across the space, and for a moment, Arthur feels the weight of the crown disappear and he is again nothing more than a man who cares for a woman. Then a small group made up of council members steps between the line of vision, and his reality comes crashing back down. Turning his gaze back to the fireplace, Arthur frowns deeply, staring intently at the log awaiting its flame, hoping it would give him an answer to his unanswered question. Thought before he can get to lost in those thoughts again, Arthur is jostled by a shivering manservant at his side. “Arthur? Clotpole?” “What, Merlin?” “You disappeared.” “Sorry,” Arthur mutters, giving his head a shake, “Why are you concerned about Mia?” Even uttering her name causes his heart to skip a beat, and it takes effort to not look back towards the blonde woman. “She’s freezing!” Merlin exclaims, although he does do well to keep his voice low, “Not all of us can afford the luxury that is heavy cloaks, you know.” As if to further prove his point, Merlin’s body gives a sudden and violent shake, his shoulders hunching further up towards his large ears. “I thought I gave you a new jacket last month.” Arthur points out, trying to act as if he wasn’t growing concerned for the health of his manservant—and best friend. “I leant it out.” Merlin mumbles, a light tinge of red appearing on his pale cheeks. “To who?!” Arthur gapes, remembering the fine material of the jacket he had gifted to Merlin as an early solstice present. That, and so the idiot wouldn’t freeze while out in the stocks. “That’s besides the point,” Merlin says as he briefly extracts a hand, waving it at Arthur, “The point is Mia. She’s freezing. Can we please light this stupid log?!” Arthur doesn’t stop himself from rolling his eyes this time, “The Yule Log is not stupid, Merlin. We burn it so—“ “So that evil spirits don’t invade us and take us over.” Merlin interrupts, “Yes, I know.” “That isn’t right.” “It’s close enough.” “Regardless,” Arthur says firmly, “We have to wait to light it.” “By then there won’t be anyone for spirits to invade.” Merlin huffs, tucking his chin down into his neckerchief, “We’ll all be frozen solid.” “Really, Merlin, are the dramatics necessary?” “Yes.” Arthur sighs, lifting a hand to rub at the spot between his eyes, wondering if it would be worth the effort of finding a new manservant. “But—“ The king groans as an interruption, ignoring the glare coming from Merlin, “But! I am not being dramatic about Mia. Look at her!” Arthur does let his eyes wander back over to the blonde, relieved to see that there is no one blocking her this time, although his deep frown returns as he notices the way her body has drawn into itself, clearly trying to keep what little heat remained in her body there. While Mia was smiling and laughing at whatever Gwen was saying, there was a light shake to her shoulder, a sure sign that she was indeed quite cold. Not wanting her to suffer, as both a king and a man in love, Arthur attempts to think of a quick and easy solution. They couldn’t light the log yet, as tradition wouldn’t allow it, and that heat would take some time to seep into the room anyways. He couldn’t disappear to get her different clothes, as he was the king and expected to remain there, not to mention he didn’t know of any females to borrow clothes from except for Gwen, who was in a similar position as Mia. And that’s when Lancelot appears at his future bride’s side, smiling down at Gwen with clear love and affection. His hands are working on the clasp by his neck, and once it’s opened, Arthur watches as his knight lifts the bright Pendragon red cloak from his shoulders and settle it over Gwen’s own. The former maidservant ducks her head to hide her blush, allowing Lancelot to adjust it against her body, ensuring it envelopes her in its warmth. The entire moment only lasts a few seconds, but it’s enough to bring a pause to the room, the love spreading a different type of warmth through the room. “He really is good for her, isn’t he?” A voice speaks softly from beside Arthur, and the king stumbles across his feet as he spins around, eyes wide and staring down into green orbs. “Oops, sorry.” “No!” Arthur barks out, wincing at his tone, “I mean—no, Mia, you don’t need to apologize.” “Yeah,” Merlin smirks as he leans around Arthur, “Because kings don’t get scared. Or jump.” “Merlin.” Arthur growls. “Yes, sire?” “Go somewhere else.” Chuckling, Merlin nods his head, “Of course, sire.” “Useless.” Arthur mumbles, shaking his head as he focuses back on Mia, who’s own lips are twitching up into a smile. “Hi.” “Hello.” She replies, “Enjoying yourself?” “I believe that’s supposed to be my question for you.” “Too late.” “Fine then.” He smiles, “I am.” “Liar.” Arthur’s eyebrow arches up, “Excuse me?” “You’re forgetting I know you, Arthur.” Mia replies, her eyes twinkling, “And I know you dread these stuffy events.” “Lighting the Yule Log is a tradition!” “Still a stuffy event.” “Yeah, suppose you’re right.” The two fall into a comfortable silence, their eyes wandering the room, but Arthur is well aware of the light shaking to Mia’s body as she stands close to his side. Clearing his throat, he glances at her from the corner of his eye, “To answer your original question…” “Hm?” “Lancelot. He is. Good for Gwen, I mean. Very good.” “Yes,” Mia sighs, “He truly is. And so lucky to be able to love her so openly.” “Mia—“ “No,” She cuts him off with a sharp shake of her head, “That is not what I meant, Arthur. I understand.” “Yes, I suppose you do.” He mumbles, his hands clenching into a fist before relaxing, a nervous energy bundling together in his stomach. “And anyways,” Mia turns her body to face his once more, the smile soft and fond as she looks up at him, “I get to be here with you, do I not?” “Yes,” Arthur returns the smile, a small and intimate one reserved for just her, “You do. Thank you for coming.” “I wouldn’t miss it.” “Even if you’re freezing?” “I have no idea what you’re talking about.” “Said through chattering teeth.” “I’m perfectly warm. Almost too warm, if I’m being honest.” “Now who’s the liar?” “Shush.” Chuckling, Arthur gives his head a shake. Stubborn, as she always was. But the difference this time was that he could do something about it. It may cause a ripple through the room, especially with so many council members being present, but it was also the beginning of solstice. A magical and wonderful time of the year. When would a better time be? Before he can think over it any further, Arthur’s hands move up to the clasp of his own cloak, and as Mia’s brows draw together in confusion, he works open the clasp and slips the cloak off of his shoulders. “You shouldn’t be cold, Mia.” Arthur says gently, settling the heavy fabric across her shoulders, amused by the way her lips form into a small ‘o’ of surprise. “Not if I can do something about it.” “Arthur—“ “No.” It’s his turn to cut her off, “This time, accept it.” “But—“ “I don’t care.” “You sure?” “Very.” He replies, his fingers tucking a blonde lock behind her ear once the clasp is secure, “Terrified, but sure.” As Mia’s lips stretch in a smile, he feels a similar expression form across his own face, and then he leans down, brushing his lips across her smiling ones. When Arthur straightens up, he’s distinctly aware of the silence in the room and the eyes resting on him. Instead of feeling worried or ashamed though, he meets the shocked gazes with a bold one, daring anyone to say a single word of protest. After no such word comes, Arthur grasps Mia’s chilled fingers in his own, lifting his other hand in the air. “Let the solstice begin! Light the log!” A loud cheer erupts around the room, shattering the previous silence, and exuding a warmth as the torch is brought forward to light the Yule Log. Arthur turns to look down at Mia, admiring the way the shade of his family’s red seems to complement the green of her eyes. “Happy solstice, love.” “Happy solstice, Arthur.”</span> <a href="#" class="summary-toggle">[ + ]</a></div><div class="stats"><div class="stat-item"><strong>Rating:</strong> General Audiences</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Archive Warning:</strong> No Archive Warnings Apply</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Category:</strong> F/M</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Fandom:</strong> Merlin (TV)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Relationship:</strong> Arthur Pendragon (Merlin)/Original Female Character(s), Gwen/Lancelot (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Character:</strong> Arthur Pendragon (Merlin), Merlin (Merlin), Gwen (Merlin), Lancelot (Merlin), Original Female Character(s)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Additional Tags:</strong> Solstice, Winter Solstice, Yule, Yule log, Cute, Fluff, tis the season</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Published:</strong> 2018-12-21</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Words:</strong> 1682</div></div></div><div class="work-entry"><h2 class="title"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://download.archiveofourown.org/downloads/17595326/Master%20and%20Mate.pdf?updated_at=1550717295" target="_blank">Master and Mate</a></h2><div class="summary">Dragonhold has once more returned to what remains of Albion, and with it is the royal family.

Words : 1000 Warnings : angst, reference to a past character death Prompt : 193: Remembrance A/N : Part fourteen of my reincarnation series Merlin and Arthur Live Again . Arthur traced the recently engraved characters with his finger. Forty-nine of them that told the only story of his mother’s life most people would ever know, but to Arthur they were a portal. Beyond the man-made letters and numbers his mind’s eye replayed memories that he hoped would live within him forever. He attempted to grin through the tears that threatened to fall as he set the flowers down in front of the granite headstone. Ten months it had been. Ten excruciating months. He lifted a hand to wipe away the tears, but gentle hands batted it away and two warm thumbs lovingly wiped away the tears and he was pulled into a hug. Arthur held on tightly as he allowed the warmth to penetrate the chill that had settled within his body. “I miss her so much.” “I know,” Merlin whispered as he kissed the top of Arthur&#x27;s head. “Thank you for making the trip to be here, Merlin. I couldn’t do this without you,” and Arthur allowed himself to imagine just what the previous ten months would have been like without having the man he loved with him every step of the way. It was unthinkable and the thought of ever losing Merlin caused him to tighten his hold on him. As his father had reminded him earlier that morning, Merlin would celebrate his seventeenth birthday in less than a month and, just as Arthur was, he was young. Were they too young for such a commitment? Arthur’s father had warned him that as much as he thought Merlin was the one for Arthur, they were both young and he should be careful because it wouldn’t do for him to give his heart away only for it to be thrown away if Merlin decided Arthur wasn’t the one for him. “I love you, Merlin,” Arthur said through his tears, but then he cleared his throat and when he thought he could speak again, he pulled back, but only enough to look into the blue eyes he knew he could stare into forever. He searched them and saw love, security, warmth and years of comfort. “Are we being foolish? Thinking this, us will be forever?” Merlin vigorously shook his head. He didn’t speak for a minute or more as his eyes searched Arthur’s face and looked imploringly into his eyes. “Do you think we’re being foolish?” he asked, trembling, the immense emotion behind his words undeniable. “Arthur?” “No,” Arthur said emphatically, smiling as he traced Merlin’s face with his fingers. How could loving Merlin ever be foolish? He leant in and brushed his lips across Merlin’s, then pulled back and turned to look down at his mother’s final resting place. “She knew you were the one for me and even Father knows how good you are for me. It scares me to think what the future could bring, but I have to trust that our love will get us through anything.” Merlin nodded and took a deep breath. “Yeah, me, too.&quot; He then knelt and picked up something from the ground and handed it to Arthur. “I know it’s a week early, but I think today is the proper time to give your birthday present to you.” Carefully unwrapping the gift, Arthur grinned as he looked at Merlin. “Your mother wrapped this, yeah?” “You surely don’t think I did, do you?” Merlin asked with a laugh. “I planned to hand the box to you as is. Mum was having none of it; she took it away last night and this morning it was on the kitchen table when I went in for breakfast.” Once the paper was removed, Arthur saw the box and looked up at Merlin. “The glasses,” he mouthed, his expression one of awe. He didn’t know what else to say as he carefully opened the familiar box he hadn’t seen in ten years. He withdrew one of the glasses, handed it to Merlin and took out the other. He swallowed. “Why both of them?” he asked. He thought Merlin should keep one. “I’ve kept them for ten years. Now it’s your turn to keep them, Arthur. You can give them back to me in another ten years. I plan on us being together for many exchanges,” Merlin said as he took the glass Arthur held and set it, along with his, in the box and placed it beside the flowers. He then sat on the ground and motioned for Arthur to do the same. “Do you remember how upset your mother was when she saw that we had real glasses in my room? I thought we were going to be grounded for life, but my mother told her not to worry, that we hadn’t spilled anything and that the glasses had been her mothers and hadn’t been used for years. Then she told me if I wanted them, I could have them.” Merlin had a goofy, dreamy look on his face. “Yeah, I remember,&quot; Arthur said as he glanced over at the box. &quot;I guess Mum was worried because Father was so strict about me not having food or drink in my room. I remember your mum putting the glasses in that box and setting it on the top shelf of your cupboard and telling you and me they were not to be used and they weren&#x27;t toys to be played with. It’s a wonder we didn’t break them that night with how hard we clinked them together.” Arthur let out a hearty laugh. “Yeah, I think that’s why she told me they were off limits; she knew how clumsy I was.” “It’s just one of your many charms that makes you so lovable, Merlin,” Arthur said as he reached out and took Merlin’s hands in his. “Thank you. I needed something to smile about today. You always know what I need and when I need it.” “And I always will, Arthur.” “Always will what?” asked Arthur&#x27;s father as he walked over to them, a bouquet of flowers in his hand. “Love your son,” Merlin said without hesitation.</span> <a href="#" class="summary-toggle">[ + ]</a></div><div class="stats"><div class="stat-item"><strong>Rating:</strong> Teen And Up Audiences</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Archive Warning:</strong> No Archive Warnings Apply</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Category:</strong> M/M</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Fandom:</strong> Merlin (TV)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Relationship:</strong> Merlin/Arthur Pendragon</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Character:</strong> Merlin (Merlin), Arthur Pendragon (Merlin), Uther Pendragon (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Additional Tags:</strong> Angst, Romance, Past Character Death, Hurt/Comfort</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Series:</strong> Part 14 of Merlin and Arthur Live Again</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Collections:</strong> Camelot Drabble -- Prompt #193: Remembrance</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Published:</strong> 2016-01-14</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Words:</strong> 1069</div></div></div><div class="work-entry"><h2 class="title"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://download.archiveofourown.org/downloads/17735927/Merlin%20BBC%20The%20Crystal.pdf?updated_at=1549850747" target="_blank">Merlin BBC: The Crystal Cave alternate ending</a></h2><div class="summary"><span class="summary-short">What if Merlin had let Morgana die?

Show and characters belong to its original creators. No copyright intended. (Takes place during the Crystal Cave episode season 3 episode 5) The rushed stomping of running feet could be heard throughout the vast forest during one afternoon. Arthur and Merlin were racing away from a group of outlaws, hearts pounding. Arthur was dressed in his usual garb of chain-link armor and boots. Merlin, his servant had on his usual blue shirt, brown jacket, pants, and bots of his own. A blue cloth covered his neck. From behind the duo, the group of men gave chase and yelled at them. Several of the men held their swords at the ready. Arthur and Merlin kept running until they reached an area with a small moss covered rock wall. They caught their breath and leaned against the wall to hide from the yelling men. Arthur peered over the top. “Are they still after us?” Merlin asked. Arthur grinned and spread out his arms. It felt good for him to be proven right. “I told you we’d outrun them,” he replied in satisfaction. “You sure?” asked a concerned Merlin, who also stood up slightly to look. “Why is it you never trust me, Merlin?” asked Arthur. Both men turned around at the sound of yelling that grew closer. The outlaws had found them. Merlin and Arthur looked at each other. ‘I told you so,’ Merlin thought. This time, Merlin led the way as Arthur ran close behind them. One of the outlaws held an axe in his right hand, his face obscured by thick cloth. Arthur and Merlin stopped by another small rocky ledge, two narrow paths going in two different directions. “Come on, this way,” said Arthur, mentioning the boy forward. “Where are we going?” asked Merlin who followed. “Trust me!” Arthur answered, making Merlin shake his head in disbelief. They climbed up a small hill and continued running. Suddenly, Merlin stopped short in fear. “Arthur,” he called. Arthur stopped and turned around. “What are you doing? Come on!” the prince urged. He grabbed Merlin by the arm and pulled him toward an opening flanked by large tree-sized stone statues. Merlin stopped in the middle to observe the statues. Covered by growing vines, the two statues revealed kings, each holding a scroll in one hand and a sword in the other. Merlin sensed that this place was not a welcoming one. He felt like they shouldn’t be there. Merlin then hurried after Arthur. “What is this place?” “The Valley of the Fallen Kings,” Arthur replied. Merlin looked at the stone faces behind more vines, one on top of the other, tribal-like. “Is it cursed?” “No,” said Arthur. “Not unless you’re superstitious.” “It is,” Merlin said. “It’s a myth,” Arthur stated. “They’ll never follow us in here. They wouldn’t dare. Trust me.” Merlin narrowed his eyes at Arthur as he led the way. “If you say that one more time…” Sure enough, the group of men bounded down the stone steps that Arthur and Merlin had walked moments earlier. Merlin and Arthur kept running for their lives, but the men ran closer and closer. Suddenly, one of the outlaws shot an arrow in the distance. It landed with a thunk into Arthur’s back. “What was that?” asked Arthur. Merlin helped Arthur up and carried him on one of his shoulders. “An arrow,” Merlin replied. “An arrow?” Arthur slurred. “Good. For a moment I thought it was something terrible.” Arthur’s eyes rolled back and he fainted face first onto the ground. Merlin stared at the arrow protruding from his back in shock. He dragged the wounded prince behind a rocky ledge, some bushes providing extra cover. Thankfully, the men didn’t notice their location and ran on by. Merlin stared up into the sky, noticing the trees growing and making a beautiful canopy against the white sky. ‘Now what am I going to do?’ he thought as he stared at the unconscious Arthur next to him. Later on that night, Merlin had a small fire going, surrounded by dirt and rocks. He carefully picked up a material wrapped in a green cloth with two sticks. He walked over to Arthur and gently placed the hot soft material against his forehead. Merlin wore a red shirt with a blue cloth around his neck. “Come on,” Merlin whispered. “Dollop head,” he added teasingly. He slapped Arthur on one of his cheeks, but he didn’t move. “I need you to recover.” Judging from Arthur’s pale face and no sign of movement, the odds weren’t looking good. He observed the wound on Arthur’s back, the arrow now out of it, revealing a small, bloody hole in his armor. He gently placed his fingers over it and muttered a healing incantation. He turned Arthur back onto his back, but still no luck. Merlin heard a bird squawk in the distance. He felt like he was being watched for some reason. He turned back to Arthur. “Listen to me, clotpole, I don’t care if you die. There are plenty of other princes. You’re not the only pompous, supercilious, condescending royal imbecile I could work for. The world is full of them. But I’m gonna give you one more chance.” Again, he placed his fingers near the wound and spoke an incantation. He turned Arthur back over and saw that nothing had changed. Saddened by the lack of effect of his magic, he washed his blood-stained hands in a nearby shallow puddle. Tears flowed from his eyes and he sobbed out loud. “Tell me…” said a man’s voice nearby. “Why are you so sad?” Through his tear filled eyes, merlin looked up at the sound of the voice. An elderly man stood in front of him wearing long brown robes caked with dirt. He had curly white hair and a white beard. Merlin could sense wisdom and something very ancient inside the man. Merlin looked over at Arthur. “It’s my friend…he’s dying, and I can’t help him.” “Then do not waste your tears,” the man replied. “For I can tell you that the time for him to die is not yet upon us.” ‘How do you know?’ Merlin thought. ‘He must also be a sorcerer.’ The man walked over toward Arthur’s still form and Merlin followed close behind. “Don’t be afraid. My name is Taliesin.” “I’m Merlin.” “I know who you are. The moment of our meeting has been written for many, many years.” He went on his knees next to Arthur. He turned toward Merlin. “You are Emrys.” The man placed his hand on Arthur’s wound, turning him over. He whispered an incantation, his eyes briefly glowing yellow. Merlin heard a series of groans from the prince. “Arthur?” he asked. “He is sleeping,” replied Taliesin. “Within hours, he will be fully recovered.” “You’re sure?” “If my memory serves me well.” “What do you mean?” “I want to show you something, Merlin.” The old man wondered forward and Merlin walked after him. “What?” he asked curiously. “You must wait and see,” he replied. As they reached a mouth of a small cave, Merlin asked a fury of questions. “Where are we going? Why have you brought me here?” “In good time,” Taliesin replied, ever patient. “You will discover all.” He chuckled and stepped to the side, allowing Merlin to ether first. Merlin entered and stared in amazement at what he saw. Quartz crystals of various sizes hung from the ceiling, while others were attached to the floor like stalactites and stalagmites. He had never seen so many crystals in one area in his life. The surfaces of the crystals gleamed in the darkness and hummed with an ancient magical energy. They seemed to be beckoning the young boy forward, to stare at them. “What is this place?” Merlin asked, looking around in amazement. “This is where magic began,” answered Taliesin. “It is the Crystal Cave.” One of the crystals attached to a rocky cavern wall pulsed with a faint light, repeatedly. Merlin looked to the side and stepped forward. To his left, a series of images flashed in one of the crystal’s surfaces. It showed doors opening, revealing Morgana on a throne in Camelot, black flags with red rowan tree symbols hanging from the walls. Morgan was dressed in lavender, wearing the elaborate bronze crown that queens wore. The next image showed Merlin as an old man, using an aging spell. Merlin turned toward Taliesin. “What is it that you see?” Taliesin asked. “Images, flashes,” Merlin said. “I’ve seen something like this before at the crystal of Neahtid.” “What you see here is exactly the same,” Taliesin answered. “For the crystal of Neahtid was hewn from this very cave.” He pointed behind Merlin. “Look into them, Emrys. Really look. Much will be revealed.” Merlin slowly turned around as voices echoed throughout the cave. The feeling put him on edge. “No!” he gasped suddenly. “Take me out of here. How do I get back to Arthur?” “The future is hidden to all but a very few, Emrys. You are one such person.” “No, I’ve been through this before,” Merlin said. “Perhaps there is a reason you were brought here at this moment in time.” “What reason?” asked Merlin. “Only the crystals can tell you,” said Taliesin with a nod. “They contain futures that are not yet born. The secrets they reveal, Emrys, are unique to you and you alone. Look into them, Emrys. Really look.” Merlin shook his head. Taliesin pointed ahead. “Use what you see for good.” Merlin stepped forward as a light shone from behind Taliesin. This time a series of images flashed before his eyes in the crystal’s surface: Morgana holding onto the reins on her white horse as it neighed and jumped back down. Morgan pulling out an ornate dagger from its sheath. Morgan walking down a hall, wearing a red robe. Red liquid wine dropping from fingers like blood. Merlin screaming though flames. Uther sleeping on a bed, while Morgana held her dagger up with both hands, lighting flashing against the blade. Uther gasping… Merlin’s yells rang throughout the cave. “What was that? What was that?!” The old man was nowhere to be seen. Merlin was on his knees, head in his hands, already traumatized by the images he saw. But one thing was clear: Morgana was planning to kill Uther. Back outside, a wad of clothing hit Merlin in the face, interrupting his troubled thoughts. “You look like a started stoat,” Arthur remarked, fully healed and standing up. “Yeah, well at least I don’t look like a bone-ide toad,” Merlin retorted. “Let’s go.” “You’re saying I look like a toad?” asked Arthur, shaking his head and holding both hands out to the side, confused. “Yeah, and maybe one day, you’ll magically transform into a handsome prince,” remarked Merlin with a grin. Arthur stared at him. Merlin muttered, “Since magic’s outlawed, that’ll probably never happen. Come on, let’s go.” “Merlin?” “What?” Merlin turned around. “I’m the one who gives the orders, remember?” “Yeah,” Merlin admitted and Arthur nodded with a smile. “You ready? Let’s go,” said Merlin, anxious to leave. ‘You just don’t get it do you?’ Arthur thought as he and Merlin made their journey back to Camelot. Soon, the two men were walking across a brown wheat field. “I don’t understand,” said Arthur to Merlin. “You said I had an arrow in my back. How come all I can feel is a slight bruise?” “Don’t know,” Merlin lied. Merlin,” said Arthur, clearly suspicious. “Did something happen you’re not telling me about?” “No.” “Come on, I’m missing your usual prattle,” Arthur admitted. He wasn’t used to Merlin being so quiet. “You’re certainly making up for it,” Merlin remarked. ‘That’s more like the idiot servant I know.’ Arthur spoke again. “You still haven’t answered my question.” Merlin came up with a story to hide the fact that magic was used. “The arrow didn’t pierce your armor, and when you fell, you knocked yourself out.” Arthur shook his head and made a face. “All right, I don’t normally say things like this, but you did a good job back there.” Merlin continued walking in silence. “Did you hear what I just said?” Arthur was expecting Merlin to grin and gloat the way he usually does during the few times Arthur complimented him. Merlin ignored him. “All right, maybe I should give you some kind of reward. What do you want?” ‘He’s going to ask for a day off as usual.’ “Some peace and quiet,” Merlin replied. Arthur was stunned into silence the rest of the way to the castle. Arthur, Merlin, and the rest of the individuals took their places before King Uther in the throne room. Colorful flags hung from the ceiling. The Pendragon symbol was etched onto the red squares of a checkerboard flag on the wall behind the throne. Morgana sat in her chair beside Uther in a white gown. Merlin stood next to Gaius, the physician and behind them stood Gwen, Morgana’s servant. Prince Arthur addressed his father, hands behind his back. “The bandits probably have a stronghold somewhere in the white mountains. How we escaped, I’ll never know. Although some credit must go to my servant, Merlin. “Dispatch a patrol,” said Uther. “I want these men caught and brought to justice.” “Immediately, father,” Arthur affirmed. “For a moment we feared you might miss Lady Morgana’s birthday,” said Uther. Morgana walked up to them and smiled. Uther patted Arthur on the shoulder, affectionately. “It’ll take more than a bunch of thieves to keep me from such a feast,” Arthur replied with a smile. “Tomorrow promises to be quite a night,” said Uther. Merlin stared at the leaving crowd, thoughts racing through his head. Merlin sat at the wooden table with Gaius at dinner that night. “Gaius, I can’t get these visions out of my head,” Merlin told his elderly guardian. Gaius leaned in. “You are extremely lucky to have seen the Crystal Cave. Long before the Great Purge, wizards would talk about it with reverence.” Merlin rubbed his forehead. “That man who led me there, who is he?” “Who was he?” asked Gaius. “He died, I’d say about 300 years ago. Taliesin was a seer to the great kings of old. It is said that the Crystal Cave was the source of his prophecies.” Merlin went quiet for a moment. “Well, he told me…” Gaius nodded, encouraging him to go on. Merlin spoke again. “He said there was a reason I was brought there at this moment in time. Why? It must mean the events I saw are imminent. Morgana is going to kill Uther.” “Well, then you must be careful,” Gaius warned. “The crystals are treacherous. What you saw may not be all that it seemed.” “So I do nothing?” Merlin asked. “There is nothing to suggest that what you saw is imminent, is there?” Gaius. “No,” Merlin responded after a moment. “So I wouldn’t let it put off your soup.” “No way.” “Come on, eat up,” said Gaius. “What is it?” asked Merlin, sniffing the soup with disgust on his spoon. To which Gaius responded, “Sometimes it’s best not to know.” Meanwhile in Arthur’s chamber, the prince was pulling on one of his boots. “You’re up?” he asked Merlin who came into the room, carrying a tray of food after opening the wooden door. Merlin placed the tray of apples by a window. “It’s Morgana’s birthday,” said Arthur. “I have to get her a present.” “What are you getting her?” asked Merlin. “Ah, it’s a secret,” Arthur answered. “Come on, you can tell me,” said Merlin as Arthur tossed a red apple in the air and caught it. “A dagger.” ‘The vision is coming true after all,’ thought Merlin with concern. His worries were further confirmed later that day when he saw Morgana holding the reins of her neighing white horse, as it raised its front legs and then landed. Morgana was wearing a lavender gown. Merlin walked into Gaius’s chambers as the old man looked through some scrolls. “It’s happening…the future I saw,” Merlin announced. “It’s started…” “Calm down, Merlin.” But Merlin was far from relaxed. “I just saw Morgana struggling with a horse exactly as she was in the crystals.” “Are you certain?” “It was the same image.” “But she’s always riding,” Gaius mentioned. “It’s not unusual to see her with a horse.” “It’s not the only thing,” said Merlin. “Arthur’s present for Morgana…he told me it’s a dagger.” “A dagger?” Gaius asked. He shook his head and sighed. “Merlin, I think you’re overreacting. It could be any dagger. As for the sight of Morgana with a horse… ” “It was the same.” “It’s hardly a rare sight,” countered Gaius. “Certainly not one to be trusted as a harbinger of doom.” “Ah Merlin,” said Arthur as Merlin later came into the room. He was sitting on a chair holding an open box in front of him. A bowl of apples and grapes was on the table as well. “Have you done my clothes for the feast?” he asked. “Uh, no,” Merlin answered, realizing he had been procrastinating on his duties. “No, no. Well, what have you been doing?” Arthur asked, annoyed. “Uh…” Merlin couldn’t think of anything to say. Arthur reached for his clothes on another chair. “Right, well you can start by pressing my robes,” He tossed his red robes into Merlin’s arms. “…and cleaning my shirts…” He threw white and brown shirts at Merlin. “…and, oh, polishing my boots,” he added as Merlin flinched when the boots almost hit him in the face. Merlin looked nervously at the box in front of Arthur. Arthur looked down at it. “Ah, Morgana’s present. What do you think?” Arthur walked over and held a small dagger in his hands. “Beautiful isn’t it, huh?” Unlike the one Merlin saw in his vision, this one had a plain brown handle and a shorter blade. Arthur held it in his hands, testing it. “Feel the balance. Feel the sharpness of the blade.” Merlin laughed nervously, “yeah.” He tested it out himself, relieved that it wasn’t the other one. Though the fact that Morgana would still have a weapon to use to kill Uther had him worried. “It’s just what every woman wants, isn’t it?” “What do you mean?” asked Arthur. “Well, I’m no expert, but don’t women only go for pretty things, like maybe jewelry?” asked Merlin. ‘He does have a point,’ thought Arthur. Later, that evening, Merlin happily turned around in front of Gaius. “How do I look?” “Same as you always do.” “Handsome,” he stated. “You’ve brightened up,” Gaius noticed. “I’ve seen Morgana’s present,” he said. “The dagger?” “It’s very plain, a bit boring.” “But not like the one you saw?” “No, that was sumptuous, ornate. I’d probably be disappointed if I were Morgana.” Gaius smiled. “Good, so now you can stop worrying.” “Oh I have,” said Merlin. “And I’m going to continue as if I’d never even met Taliesin. I’m going to enjoy this feast like everyone else.” “Even if it’s for Morgana,” Gaius said. Merlin nodded and left. ‘I have a bad feeling he may have jinxed fate,’ Gaius thought. “To Lady Morgana!” cheered the crowd, clanging their goblets together in a toast. Morgana smiled genuinely at the scene in a beautiful cream colored dress. She was sitting to the left of King Uther, with a plate of food in front of her. Arthur sat at his father’s right side. White candles were placed in holders and positioned on the tables. Upbeat music played in the background and laughter could be heard throughout the dining chamber. Morgana smiled as Uther gave her a beautiful necklace that she put around her neck. Arthur nodded to Merlin, excited to see how she would react to his gift. One of the guards walked in front of her and bowed respectfully, holding a small box in his hands. “Happy birthday,” said Arthur. “Arthur,” she replied in thanks. She opened the box and pulled out an ornate dagger in a decorated sheath. It was not the one Merlin had seen before. It was the same dagger that appeared in the vision. Everyone clapped as she sat back down. “It’s not often you’re right, Merlin,” said Arthur. “But this is one of those rare occasions. Girls do like pretty things. Thanks.” He pat Merlin on the back and wondered off. “Don’t you see?” Merlin asked, sitting beside Gaius later that night. “It’s started. It’s coming true.” “You can’t be certain about that,” Gaius responded. “We have to stop her.” “How? Merlin, we don’t know when this is going to happen. We don’t even know if it will.” “We have to watch her,” Merlin stated. “Night and day?” Gaius asked aghast. Clearly Merlin was losing his mind. “I was shown these visions for a reason,” said Merlin. “This is madness,” said Gaius. “We’re taking turns,” said Merlin. “She cannot be left alone.” Merlin ran toward the door and managed to hide behind a flowered curtain in Morgana’s chambers. The door opened and Gwen stepped inside the room. She strode toward Morgana who was sitting on a chair, examining the dagger in front of a mirror. “You got some lovely presents,” Gwen said, a little jealous. “Many hairbrushes.” Morgana rolled her eyes. Morgana held up a mirror with a name on it. Gwen stared at the name confused. “Who’s King Gromause?” There was a note tied to the mirror handle in red ribbon. Morgana shook her head. “At least he doesn’t think my hair needs brushing,” she said with a laugh. “It’s so pretty,” said Gwen. “Here, I want you to have this,” Morgana said. “Me? No I…” “It’s a thank you.” She handed her a white handkerchief with gold designs on it. “Thank you,” said Gwen. She walked away and closed the door. Checking to see that no one was looking, Morgana breathed on the mirror. In the glass was a message: Sister, Come to the darkling woods at midnight. Morgause Morgana smiled. The bell tolled throughout the night as a full moon shone in the clear dark sky. The door opened from Morgana’s chambers and Merlin quietly gasped, awake. He peered out though the curtain and saw Morgana dressed in a red robe and hood. ‘She’s going to kill Uther, I know it,’ he thought. She placed her sheathed dagger into the belt around her waist. Merlin moved from his hiding place and watched Morgana walk down the hallway. It was the same image he had seen in the crystal. Merlin peered behind a corner. He had to do something fast. He tilted his chin down and his eyes turned yellow. The double doors shut abruptly in front of Morgana. A nearby torch leaned forward, almost falling on her. She stepped backward and lost her footing. With a loud scream, she tumbled roughly down a flight of stairs. “No,” Merlin gasped. He ran down the hall and stopped on the top of the stairs. To his horror, morgana was lying unconscious at the bottom of the stairs, blood slowly flowing from the side of her left forehead. Gaius, Arthur, Merlin and Gwen were quick on the scene. Merlin carried Morgana up the stairs while Gaius led the way to his chamber. Arthur followed behind, concerned. “We need water and bandages,” said Gaius. “I’ll get that,” replied Gwen running to the back of the room. “And yarrow…we need to stop the bleeding.” Gaius pushed aside bowls, books and jars of herbs to make room on the wooden table to lie Morgana down. Gaius and Arthur gently placed her on the table. “She’s having problems breathing,” he mentioned with concern. “Dianthus?” Merlin asked. “Yes, and a preparation of Pulmonaria,” said Gaius listing off essential herbs needed for the task. “Lungwort, Merlin,” he added. “Quarter of an ounce, ground fine and mixed with violet.” Merlin went to gather the healing herbs from a nearby self. “How could this have happened?” asked Arthur. “Arthur, I need room here,” stated Gaius. “Yes, of course. Anything you need, just tell me.” Merlin got to work preparing the herbs while Gaius sewed the skin on her forehead together with string and small scissors. “Will she be alright?” asked Gwen. “We’ve done the best we can,” Gaius said. “I can heal her skin, Gwen. “But the skull…the cranium is broken. She’s bleeding inside.” Merlin stared, then left, Gaius glancing at him. Merlin sat in his room, resting his head on his hand, solemnly. Gaius opened the door and Merlin looked up. Gaius sat next to Merlin and put his hand on his back comfortingly, as if he were his own son. He knew that Merlin would have something to do with Morgana getting hurt. “I had to stop the future,” Merlin stated. “I had to stop Morgana from killing Uther. I didn’t mean to do it like this.” “It wasn’t your fault, Merlin,” said Gaius. “I averted something much worse from happening,” Merlin said. But which was worse, Morgana’s death or Uther’s? “I just…wish there could have been some other way.” Gaius nodded in understanding. The next morning, no one was more upset about Morgana’s accident than Uther. He sat by her bedside for hours while Gaius looked on. He tenderly rubbed her head with his black gloved hand. Morgana’s face was pale and still. The wound on her forehead was gone, but she had not awoken. Gwen, too, was also sad about Morgana’s condition. She wept loudly against Arthur who held her close in a hug and comforted her. Later on, Arthur came into the main hall, silent. His armor, gloves, and chain-link shirt were lying on the table. “Sword belt, Merlin, where’s my sword belt?” Merlin went to retrieve it. The belt was wrapped around a sword. “What the hell’s it doing over there?” Arthur asked. Merlin didn’t speak. Arthur began to untangle the belt. “It’s twisted, here,” said Merlin. “Here.” Arthur shrugged and tossed it to him. The belt was soon free. “I’m sorry about Morgana,” said Merlin. “If Gaius could do something, he would.” “After all we went through to rescue her…for her to survive all that…” began Arthur. “I know.” “I lose her now like this…” Arthur went silent for a moment. “I’ve grown up with her. She’s like a sister to me. I’d sacrifice my place on the throne for her to see another sunrise.” ‘Maybe letting her die is a very bad idea, after all,’ thought Merlin. Back in Gaius’s chamber, Uther was tenderly stroking Morgana’s face. “So beautiful,” “Yes, sire,” Gaius agreed. Six white candles were positioned around the area. “I cannot watch her die, Gaius,” said Uther, already beginning to sob. “I wish there was something I could do,” said Gaius. “No, you don’t understand,” replied Uther. “I cannot lose her. No matter what happens, she cannot die.” “I will do everything I can, sire,” answered Gaius. “No Gaius, whatever it takes…whatever I don’t care.” Merlin was listening in from behind the door. Was the king seriously suggesting the one thing he hated the most? “You must save her,” Uther said. “If I knew a way…” Gaius began. “You’re not understanding me, Gaius.” The king turned to him. “Cure her. I don’t care what remedy you use. In all these books there must be something. Something in the Old Religion?” Gaius was taken aback at his statement. “Are you suggesting…” “Sorcery, yes,” said Uther. “I know she’s dear to you, sire,” said Uther. “But surely you’re not going to risk everything for Morgana.” “Gaius, you don’t understand,” Uther said again. “There’s something you should know. Something I’ve told no one.” He paused and turned to Gaius. “Morgana is my daughter.” ‘What?!’ thought a wide-eyed Merlin. Uther continued. “It was while Gorlois was away. He was fighting on the northern plans. Her mother Vivian, grew lonely.” “I understand, sire,” said Gaius. “”I’ve said enough,” said Uther, standing up. “The people must never know who Morgana really is, for Arthur’s sake.” “I assure you, sire, the secret is safe with me.” Uther nodded and walked away. Gaius opened the door to find Merlin hiding behind it. He closed it and faced Merlin. ‘That explains everything,” said Merlin. “No wonder he spent a year looking for her.” “Now we know why she can do no wrong,” said Gaius. But Merlin was dubious about his claim. Uther sobbed in front of a window, looking out at the palace courtyard. “Sire,” Merlin asked, as he came into the room. “This is from Gaius. He thought it might help ease your mind.” He placed a small potion on a table. Uther ignored him, still staring forlornly out the window. Merlin bowed, getting ready to leave the king some time to himself. “You are Gaius’s boy,” said Uther, just as Merlin had started to walk away. “He is my guardian,” Merlin responded. “You’re like a son to him.” “Yes.” “I see the way he cares for you. You feel your child’s every joy and their pain. You watch their failings and you see your own. All you want is for their happiness. For them to escape the suffering of life. Why has this happened?” Merlin didn’t have words. “I would…I would do anything, any…” Uther broke down sobbing into his hand. Merlin left the room and went outside in the rain. Arthur was busy slashing at a training dummy with his sword. He was also clearly upset at recent events. “Her breath is leaving her,” muttered Gaius, as Merlin came back into Gaius’s chamber. Gwen and Gaius stood and watched over Morgana, still lying in bed without movement. “She’ll be gone by morning,” Gaius stated. Both of them looked up when they saw Merlin enter. Merlin took one last look and walked into his room as Gwen sobbed in a chair at Morgana’s bedside. Later on, as Merlin watched Morgana being care for by Gaius and Gwen, he knew what to do next. Sneaking out of the castle, he rode off into the night on horseback, incanting in the language of the dragons. Kilgharrah, the old giant dragon, heard his call and landed onto the grass covered ground in a clearing. The white castle in Camelot stood on a rocky cliff whole the full moon lit up the night. “You summoned me, young warlock?” he asked. “And to what do I owe the pleasure this time?” “I’ve been to the Crystal Cave,” said Merlin. “I saw Morgana make an attempt on Uther’s life. “It does not surprise me,” stated Kilgharrah. “Well, I stopped her.” “To change the future is no simple matter, Merlin,” said the dragon. “To do so is fraught with danger.” “I know, and as a result of my action, Morgana is dying,” responded Merlin. “Then you should rejoice,” the dragon added, clearly pleased of the events. Merlin grinned for a moment, then he said. “I want you to help me to save her.” He couldn’t bear to watch his friends and the kingdom grieve for much longer. “Merlin, have you learnt nothing?” Kilgharrah asked. “I did not mean to kill her. All I wanted was to avoid the future that would have unfolded…” said Merlin. “To prevent Uther’s death; to prevent Camelot being torn apart.” “I will not cure her,” stated the dragon. “She is Uther’s daughter.” “Yes.” Merlin chuckled in surprise. “You knew? Why didn’t you tell me?” “It makes no difference,” the dragon responded, nonchalantly. “Well, whatever she was about to do, I stopped her,” said Merlin. “There’s no need for people to suffer.” “The witch must die, as she should have done long ago,” boomed Kilgarrah. “I will not save her.” “Then I’ll save her myself!” said Merlin. Merlin was so angry, he was tempted to command the dragon to help save Morgana. But he held his feelings in. “Very well,” the dragon seethed. “But I warn you, if you do save her, the evil that will follow, is of your doing and yours alone.” The dragon flew off into the night. Merlin rode back into the castle and arrived back into Gaius’s chambers to find Gwen in the same spot beside Morgana. “I’ll sit with her,” said Merlin. “Why don’t you go and get some sleep? You must be exhausted.” Gwen groaned and Merlin helped her up. “If she wakes up…” she began. “I’ll call you,” Merlin finished. “Thank you.” She looked sadly at Morgana and left. Merlin watched as Gwen left the room and closed the door. He leaned down and looked at Morgana. Merlin placed his hand by her forehead and muttered an incantation, his eyes glowing yellow. After a few moments… He tried a second healing spell he knew. Nothing. He tried a third and a fourth and a fifth. Still nothing. Merlin knew with dread that it was too late to ask the dragon for help again. He had wished he had ordered him to give Merlin the spell he needed to revive her. Merlin broke down into tears after he felt the last of her energy slip away. Gaius came in the next morning after retrieving a jar of herbs. He walked into the room and stopped short. Uther was holding Morgana close in a hug, her not moving. “I’m sorry, sire,” Gaius said quietly. “You… you tried to use sorcery, right?” “I assure you sire, I did nothing like that. And even if I did…” Both men went silent, the two of them knowing the truth. “Of course, I understand,” answered Uther, lowering his head in sadness. Merlin sat on a white ledge, head in his hands. Gaius sat next to him. “I couldn’t let the future come to pass,” said Merlin. “I know,” said Gaius. “But you are playing with things that are beyond you.” Outside in the forest, Morgause knew what happened because she could feel her sister’s energy disappear. She originally planned to sneak into the castle to meet with Morgana, wondering why she hadn’t come meet her the night before. Uther, Arthur, Gwen and everyone else cried in the morning during morgana’s funeral. Uther and Arthur stood in front of Morgana’s body, lying in a Viking rowboat. Uther placed flowers into her white hands and stroked her face one last time. Morgana and the boat sailed slowly over the lake water. An archer dressed in a red robe fired a flaming arrow and it landed in the boat, setting her body on fire. Without Morgana, both Uther and Arthur would live. Though several times, Uther would attempt to commit suicide due to his intense grief. Arthur would grow up and become the kingdom’s finest ruler, happily sitting by Gwen’s side. Mordred would remain loyal, not influenced by the oppression faced by the Old Religion worshippers. Arthur’s journey to retrieve the Golden Trident would go much easier, without Morgana draining him of his energy using the Eye of the Phoenix bracelet. The Cup of Life would remain safely in the hands of the Druids, without morgana seeking it to create an undead army. The spirits of the other world would not be released, due to Morgana not sacrificing Morgause. Lancelot would still be alive due to not sacrificing himself through the portal to the other world. Uther would still be gravely wounded after Arthur’s birthday party, but would not die due to not wearing Morgana’s cursed necklace (unless Morgause snuck the necklace in herself). Merlin would not try to assassinate Arthur due to Morgana not being around to curse him. The sword in the stone is not needed, and Morgana’s undead army is not created. The events of Morgana using the princess to sneak into Camelot do not occur. Camelot’s knights are not lured into a trap by Cenred and his men. Gwen is not tortured by Morgana’s mandrakes in the Dark Tower, thus Gwen does not turn against Arthur and Merlin, brainwashed. Due to this, she does not need to be cured in the White Cauldron. Alator survives and Merlin’s identity is kept secret. Mordred still falls in love with Kara and turns on Arthur due to him ordering her to be killed for being a spy. Mordred escapes in his grief and eventually kills Arthur in battle before dying himself. Merlin does not kill morgana because she is gone. Mordred reveals Merlin’s true name to the enemy and Morgause. Morgause instead, leads the enemy against Camelot, but Merlin kills her as well with the sword forged in a dragon’s breath. Gwen rules Camelot by herself, saddened at Arthur’s death.</span> <a href="#" class="summary-toggle">[ + ]</a></div><div class="stats"><div class="stat-item"><strong>Rating:</strong> Teen And Up Audiences</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Archive Warning:</strong> Choose Not To Use Archive Warnings</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Fandom:</strong> Merlin (TV)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Character:</strong> Merlin (Merlin), Arthur Pendragon (Merlin), Morgana (Merlin) Stats: Published: 2019-02-11 Words: 6102 Merlin BBC: The Crystal Cave alternate ending by KathyPrior42 Summary What if Merlin had let Morgana die? Show and characters belong to its original creators. No copyright intended. (Takes place during the Crystal Cave episode season 3 episode 5) The rushed stomping of running feet could be heard throughout the vast forest during one afternoon. Arthur and Merlin were racing away from a group of outlaws, hearts pounding. Arthur was dressed in his usual garb of chain-link armor and boots. Merlin, his servant had on his usual blue shirt, brown jacket, pants, and bots of his own. A blue cloth covered his neck. From behind the duo, the group of men gave chase and yelled at them. Several of the men held their swords at the ready. Arthur and Merlin kept running until they reached an area with a small moss covered rock wall. They caught their breath and leaned against the wall to hide from the yelling men. Arthur peered over the top. “Are they still after us?” Merlin asked. Arthur grinned and spread out his arms. It felt good for him to be proven right. “I told you we’d outrun them, ” he replied in satisfaction. “You sure?” asked a concerned Merlin, who also stood up slightly to look. “Why is it you never trust me, Merlin?” asked Arthur. Both men turned around at the sound of yelling that grew closer. The outlaws had found them. Merlin and Arthur looked at each other. ‘I told you so, ’ Merlin thought. This time, Merlin led the way as Arthur ran close behind them. One of the outlaws held an axe in his right hand, his face obscured by thick cloth. Arthur and Merlin stopped by another small rocky ledge, two narrow paths going in two different directions. “Come on, this way, ” said Arthur, mentioning the boy forward. “Where are we going?” asked Merlin who followed. “Trust me!” Arthur answered, making Merlin shake his head in disbelief. They climbed up a small hill and continued running. Suddenly, Merlin stopped short in fear. “Arthur, ” he called. Arthur stopped and turned around. “What are you doing? Come on!” the prince urged. He grabbed Merlin by the arm and pulled him toward an opening flanked by large tree-sized stone statues. Merlin stopped in the middle to observe the statues. Covered by growing vines, the two statues revealed kings, each holding a scroll in one hand and a sword in the other. Merlin sensed that this place was not a welcoming one. He felt like they shouldn’t be there. Merlin then hurried after Arthur. “What is this place?” “The Valley of the Fallen Kings, ” Arthur replied. Merlin looked at the stone faces behind more vines, one on top of the other, tribal-like. “Is it cursed?” “No, ” said Arthur. “Not unless you’re superstitious.” “It is, ” Merlin said. “It’s a myth, ” Arthur stated. “They’ll never follow us in here. They wouldn’t dare. Trust me.” Merlin narrowed his eyes at Arthur as he led the way. “If you say that one more time…” Sure enough, the group of men bounded down the stone steps that Arthur and Merlin had walked moments earlier. Merlin and Arthur kept running for their lives, but the men ran closer and closer. Suddenly, one of the outlaws shot an arrow in the distance. It landed with a thunk into Arthur’s back. “What was that?” asked Arthur. Merlin helped Arthur up and carried him on one of his shoulders. “An arrow, ” Merlin replied. “An arrow?” Arthur slurred. “Good. For a moment I thought it was something terrible.” Arthur’s eyes rolled back and he fainted face first onto the ground. Merlin stared at the arrow protruding from his back in shock. He dragged the wounded prince behind a rocky ledge, some bushes providing extra cover. Thankfully, the men didn’t notice their location and ran on by. Merlin stared up into the sky, noticing the trees growing and making a beautiful canopy against the white sky. ‘Now what am I going to do?’ he thought as he stared at the unconscious Arthur next to him. Later on that night, Merlin had a small fire going, surrounded by dirt and rocks. He carefully picked up a material wrapped in a green cloth with two sticks. He walked over to Arthur and gently placed the hot soft material against his forehead. Merlin wore a red shirt with a blue cloth around his neck. “Come on, ” Merlin whispered. “Dollop head, ” he added teasingly. He slapped Arthur on one of his cheeks, but he didn’t move. “I need you to recover.” Judging from Arthur’s pale face and no sign of movement, the odds weren’t looking good. He observed the wound on Arthur’s back, the arrow now out of it, revealing a small, bloody hole in his armor. He gently placed his fingers over it and muttered a healing incantation. He turned Arthur back onto his back, but still no luck. Merlin heard a bird squawk in the distance. He felt like he was being watched for some reason. He turned back to Arthur. “Listen to me, clotpole, I don’t care if you die. There are plenty of other princes. You’re not the only pompous, supercilious, condescending royal imbecile I could work for. The world is full of them. But I’m gonna give you one more chance.” Again, he placed his fingers near the wound and spoke an incantation. He turned Arthur back over and saw that nothing had changed. Saddened by the lack of effect of his magic, he washed his blood-stained hands in a nearby shallow puddle. Tears flowed from his eyes and he sobbed out loud. “Tell me…” said a man’s voice nearby. “Why are you so sad?” Through his tear filled eyes, merlin looked up at the sound of the voice. An elderly man stood in front of him wearing long brown robes caked with dirt. He had curly white hair and a white beard. Merlin could sense wisdom and something very ancient inside the man. Merlin looked over at Arthur. “It’s my friend…he’s dying, and I can’t help him.” “Then do not waste your tears, ” the man replied. “For I can tell you that the time for him to die is not yet upon us.” ‘How do you know?’ Merlin thought. ‘He must also be a sorcerer.’ The man walked over toward Arthur’s still form and Merlin followed close behind. “Don’t be afraid. My name is Taliesin.” “I’m Merlin.” “I know who you are. The moment of our meeting has been written for many, many years.” He went on his knees next to Arthur. He turned toward Merlin. “You are Emrys.” The man placed his hand on Arthur’s wound, turning him over. He whispered an incantation, his eyes briefly glowing yellow. Merlin heard a series of groans from the prince. “Arthur?” he asked. “He is sleeping, ” replied Taliesin. “Within hours, he will be fully recovered.” “You’re sure?” “If my memory serves me well.” “What do you mean?” “I want to show you something, Merlin.” The old man wondered forward and Merlin walked after him. “What?” he asked curiously. “You must wait and see, ” he replied. As they reached a mouth of a small cave, Merlin asked a fury of questions. “Where are we going? Why have you brought me here?” “In good time, ” Taliesin replied, ever patient. “You will discover all.” He chuckled and stepped to the side, allowing Merlin to ether first. Merlin entered and stared in amazement at what he saw. Quartz crystals of various sizes hung from the ceiling, while others were attached to the floor like stalactites and stalagmites. He had never seen so many crystals in one area in his life. The surfaces of the crystals gleamed in the darkness and hummed with an ancient magical energy. They seemed to be beckoning the young boy forward, to stare at them. “What is this place?” Merlin asked, looking around in amazement. “This is where magic began, ” answered Taliesin. “It is the Crystal Cave.” One of the crystals attached to a rocky cavern wall pulsed with a faint light, repeatedly. Merlin looked to the side and stepped forward. To his left, a series of images flashed in one of the crystal’s surfaces. It showed doors opening, revealing Morgana on a throne in Camelot, black flags with red rowan tree symbols hanging from the walls. Morgan was dressed in lavender, wearing the elaborate bronze crown that queens wore. The next image showed Merlin as an old man, using an aging spell. Merlin turned toward Taliesin. “What is it that you see?” Taliesin asked. “Images, flashes, ” Merlin said. “I’ve seen something like this before at the crystal of Neahtid.” “What you see here is exactly the same, ” Taliesin answered. “For the crystal of Neahtid was hewn from this very cave.” He pointed behind Merlin. “Look into them, Emrys. Really look. Much will be revealed.” Merlin slowly turned around as voices echoed throughout the cave. The feeling put him on edge. “No!” he gasped suddenly. “Take me out of here. How do I get back to Arthur?” “The future is hidden to all but a very few, Emrys. You are one such person.”</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Published:</strong> 2019-02-11</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Words:</strong> 6102</div></div></div><div class="work-entry"><h2 class="title"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://download.archiveofourown.org/downloads/652087/Merlin%20and%20Arthur.pdf?updated_at=1387157452" target="_blank">Merlin and Arthur: Confrontation</a></h2><div class="summary"><span class="summary-short">Quite simply, the lyrics of &#x27;The Confrontation&#x27; from Les Misérables rewritten for a scenario in which Arthur finds out about Merlin&#x27;s magic.

He&#x27;s trembling as if they were out in the snowy mountains wearing only tunics and thin trousers, but they&#x27;re not. It is the middle of summer and they are in the lush green forest that surrounds Camelot. It could be a beautiful clearing really, if only it wasn&#x27;t splattered with Merlin&#x27;s blood. It had all happened so fast Arthur wasn&#x27;t even sure of all the details. Merlin and Arthur had been riding slowly after going out on a hunt because the prince thought it was high time he torture his servant with one. He got a few rabbits before calling it quits, he knew Merlin didn&#x27;t like to watch any of the animals die, and Arthur had secretly only really wanted Merlin&#x27;s sole company anyway. Then there was rustling in the trees and they did as they always did. They hopped off their horses with impressive stealth and arranged themselves in a way that Arthur was ready to pummel anyone who got within ten feet of Merlin and Merlin went to go hide behind a tree, probably. The men who came charging into the little clearing didn&#x27;t look like much, low-level bandits, Arthur guessed and so he set to work dispatching them. As he fought with the first two he got the nagging feeling these men were not what they seemed, for they fought with gusto and a technique not learned from robbing strangers in the woods. This was an assassination then, but why were the men disguised? Arthur worked through all the possibilities as he finally finished off the first man with a clean slice of his sword across the mans jugular. The spray of blood that ensued provided him with a moment of distraction as the other men looked at their comrade die. Without missing a beat he was on to the second, clearly he had been friends with the first one if the fury in his eyes was anything to go by. Good. Arthur could use fury, he had never met a man who could keep good technique and fury at the same time, and as it turned out the man in front of him was not the exception. Extracting his sword from the mans stomach with a - sching - he swiveled around to the third who was ... gone? Arthur looked around only to see the man unconscious under a particularly hefty tree branch next to another man Arthur hadn&#x27;t even seen. That takes care of all four of them, thought Arthur as he heard the crunch of Merlin&#x27;s boots walking over to him. Merlin had a very distinctive walking pattern, it was strangely timed and every so often the pattern would break as he stumbled over air. Without turning he could see the goofy grin Merlin would be wearing, he never took things as seriously as he should. &quot;That&#x27;s that then,&quot; he called gaily from behind Arthur. He couldn&#x27;t help the answering grin that came to him but he didn&#x27;t turn around and let Merlin see it, instead he walked toward the man who was lying next to the broken tree branch. Something was off. &quot;Those men couldn&#x27;t have been bandits Merlin, they were all too good with a sword. If it hadn&#x27;t been for these men luckily getting knocked unconscious ... I don&#x27;t think I could&#x27;ve fought them all off at once. &quot; Arthur admitted. He was the best knight in Camelot and his sword skills were unmatched, but none of those men had been particularly bad and when you have four against one Arthur should at least be severely wounded. Finally he swivels to Merlin to see a look of confusion that only morphs into one of terror. &quot;What?&quot; Arthur says hurrying toward Merlin. &quot;It&#x27;s Morgana,&quot; he says gravely. &quot;How?&quot; &quot;Those men would&#x27;ve finished you off if I- if the tree branch hadn&#x27;t incapacitated two of them, and they found us in the middle of the woods as if they had a map leading them directly to you. Magic. But if it is her she would be smarter than to send just four skilled men.&quot; As if on cue there was shuffling and three more men appeared from the tree line, but these men looked very different. They moved with am almost unnatural swiftness as they stayed low to the ground. Their robes swirled around them in illusions of location. Merlin recognized them as Catha by the way they moved and the markings on their skin. Arthur was a great warrior and he had taken care of the men he could, with a little help from Merlin, but now he was defenseless and Merlin had no one to give him a secret hand from the tree line. Merlin was Emrys but he was young and had almost died enough times to not let stupid prophecy&#x27;s about his power go to his head, compared to three catha assassins Merlin did not know how he would fare. They tunneled their magic into their movements and flowed like water around the duo keeping such constant motion they could not be pinned down. Burns started to sting Merlin and Arthur&#x27;s skin and as they looked down they realized they already had multiple small slices left from whatever weapons the men were apparently holding. Arthur steeled himself and brought up his sword, they were unlike anyone he had faced before but he was a warrior and refused to be defeated without a battle. Merlin&#x27;s hands shook as he knew what had to happen but then there was clanging and it seems Arthur was in fact helping Merlin because him and one of the catha men were engaged in a raging battle of strength and skill. Merlin could feel the mans magic wasn&#x27;t that strong, but his skill was shocking and Arthur was struggling. Merlin took a deep breath and let the magic in his core flow out to his limbs, maybe if he only let down the tight hold he always had on his magic he wouldn&#x27;t have to do something blatantly obvious and hurt Arthur with the truth. It felt as if time stopped as his magic made its way into his very bloodstream and touched every corner of his body. The world was bright with colors he felt never existed and oxygen was crisp in his lungs. He moved without the clumsiness of restrained magic and a sense of peace overcame him, no matter what happened now he knew he could keep Arthur safe. Latching on to the Catha mans magic in front of him he tracked his movements easier and allowed himself to go on offense for once. The man in front of him seemed to sense the change and stared intently into Merlin&#x27;s eyes as the warlock moved in tandem with him. Merlin&#x27;s magic corralled the assassin&#x27;s magic and slowed the man to level the playing field. Merlin had never felt so focused. With smooth movements he moved in toward the man and grasped the overflowing sleeve of his robe. He saw now the small blades that hung in a circle around the hem of the sleeve and marveled at the Catha&#x27;s ingenuity before twisting the sleeve and locking the mans arm behind his back. He fell to his knees but swiftly rolled bringing Merlin down with him. His body moved efficiently over Merlin until his thighs wrapped around his right arm and legs rested across his chest. He leaned back and arched his hips harshly pulling on Merlin&#x27;s arms. Merlin could feel the pressure building in his elbow into an intense pain, he knew if he didn&#x27;t move it would snap. A pained grunt escaped his lips as he attempted to get up but he was not moving one bit. &quot;Merlin!&quot; He heard Arthur scream from somewhere behind him, he let magic flow to his arm with a charge so strong it left the Catha breathless, his grip slipped and Merlin ripped his arm out of the grasp. It still screamed with pain and he thought surely a ligament tore but he didn&#x27;t have time for roundabouts or thinking anymore, something was scaring Arthur and that was unacceptable. With a blast of power and light that left his palm he hit the man. He flew backward as if hit by a giant boulder and his bones crunching against the ground were all Merlin needed to hear before he turned to Arthur. The prince was tired and bloody but the man who he was fighting was too. The sight of the magical display shocked both of them into inaction but the catha recovered much quicker. With an aching heart Merlin blasted him as well narrowly missing Arthur himself. He ran to Arthur with as fast as he could after expending large amounts of magic and revealing his biggest secret. He arrived short of breath and singularly focused on the look of pain and confusion passing over Arthur&#x27;s face. &quot;Merlin, wha- what was that?&quot; he asked sounding lost, which was so much worse than angry. Merlin risked reaching out and holding Arthur by the shoulders. He made sure to give him as much space as he could and held him an arms length away as if to say don&#x27;t be afraid, I am completely visible to you, I could never harm you. Merlin&#x27;s heart skipped a beat when Arthur didn&#x27;t flinch away but instead leaned in to the touch. &quot;Merlin, tell me what that was,&quot; he whispered in the space between them like he was afraid to break whatever it was that was happening. Merlin opened his mouth to explain it all to Arthur, to get everything off his chest and beg for forgiveness. He could survive all kinds of battles and creatures but he did not think he could survive another second looking at the utter pain in Arthur&#x27;s eyes. Except instead of an explanation all the came was a soft gasp. His gaze dropped down to his stomach where silver gleamed beautifully in the sun. From his angle it was almost hard to spot the blade; the thin slice of silver protruded from his gut. Tuh Tump, Tuh Tump, Tuh Tump, his heart beat boomed in his chest and blood roared in his ears. The rush of blood began to soak his tunic and when he looked up he could see Arthur screaming something but all he could hear was a high pitched ringing. The silver blade twisted in his back cutting more into his intestines and finally was wrenched out. The third catha he thought to himself with almost amusement growing in his chest. He didn&#x27;t hear or see the catha die, but he felt his magic curl around the mans neck and snap it fiercely with an anger he himself didn&#x27;t feel. Arthur was safe. With that thought his adrenaline and shock slipped away. The pain began to grow and intensify as if someone had lit a fire inside his intestines. It seared him and as the ringing dissipated from his ears he understood those distant whimpers and sobs were coming from him. He did not know when he had fallen to the ground but he was half kneeling and half in Arthur&#x27;s arms. The pain ebbed and flowed as he fell more and more into Arthur. At least Arthur didn&#x27;t hate him, that was more than Merlin had dared let himself hope for. Arthur&#x27;s hands were grasping at his face, his palms sweaty on Merlin&#x27;s own clammy skin. He moved to lie Merlin down and try to cover the wound with his hands. They both knew it was too big; bleeding too much and too fast. It was sticky and hot as it flowed underneath him in a shiny pool of red. Tears sprang to Arthur&#x27;s eyes and blurred his vision as he tried to put pressure on the wound anyway. The blood flowed over his fingers, the deep red color staining his pale skin. Merlin&#x27;s blood. Merlin began to shake terribly and whimper softly, his own hand came to sit on top of Arthur&#x27;s and the dam broke. A choking sound escaped Arthur&#x27;s chest and he couldn&#x27;t bear to look at his friends face, Merlin&#x27;s face. &quot;-rthur&quot; he gasped out urging his eyes to meet Merlin&#x27;s, &quot;It&#x27;s alright.&quot; And Arthur knows he&#x27;s forgiving him for something he will never forgive himself for. They have too much to do and say still, Merlin can&#x27;t die yet! He just can&#x27;t! So that&#x27;s exactly what Arthur tells him. He just smiles softly and sadly knowing at least one of the things they need to speak about is his magic. &quot;Promise I&#x27;m not evil,&quot; he says as his head lulls against Arthur&#x27;s chest, &quot;I only ever used it for you. Only you, Arthur.&quot; It&#x27;s meant to be a reassurance but Arthur doesn&#x27;t think anything has ever hurt so much. He gives in then; Merlin won&#x27;t survive this and Arthur will not let Merlin&#x27;s last moments be filled with doubt or guilt. &quot;You idiot,&quot; he says and cradles his love closer, &quot;I know you&#x27;re not evil.&quot; &quot;Prat. I save your life and you call me an idiot.&quot; Merlin&#x27;s body is no longer trembling and his voice is clearer but tired; Arthur knows that&#x27;s not a good sign, he&#x27;s seen it too many times before. &quot;I am a prat. A royal one, and that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m commanding you to stay alive,&quot; he says forcing lightness into his voice, the huff of laughter it earns him breaks him all the more. Merlin grimaces after the laugh as if he had forgotten he was mortally wounded and it would hurt. &quot;You never did understand you couldn&#x27;t have everything you wanted just because you&#x27;re the prince,&quot; Merlin teases as he looks up at Arthur from his arms. Arthur swallows and lets himself smile at Merlin like he always wished he could. He smiles and love and adoration are written in every corner of his face, &quot;I know exactly what it&#x27;s like not being able to have the things I want ... the people I want. Person I want.&quot; His thumb brushes a tear off of Merlin&#x27;s cheek and does not stop roaming his cheekbones even after he&#x27;s done. Red smears his pale cheeks now. &quot;You ass, I waited for you all these years,&quot; Merlin pants out, &quot;and you wait until I&#x27;m dying to tell me.&quot; A bark of laughter leaves Arthur&#x27;s chest, &quot;I know I&#x27;m an ass. And I know you don&#x27;t follow orders you useless servant, but could you follow this one Merlin? For me?&quot; Arthur chokes on the last words as his voice finally breaks and he hangs his head down to touch Merlin&#x27;s forehead. He feel&#x27;s Merlin&#x27;s bloody hands raise to touch Arthur&#x27;s cheeks and hair, caressing and comforting as if Arthur were the one dying. &quot;I love you, Arthur,&quot; He rasps out filled with pain and Arthur can tell it&#x27;s far deeper than the physical one he&#x27;s in right now, &quot;I&#x27;d do anything for you.&quot; And then his hands fall. They just lie there on top of his own chest. Arthur clutches Merlin closer, and if Merlin were alive he would&#x27;ve cried out in pain, but he doesn&#x27;t. A shuddering cry passes Arthur&#x27;s lips and suddenly a tsunami of tears overtakes his vision. He buries his face in Merlin&#x27;s hair. It&#x27;s soft, so so soft. The pool of blood was now soaking into the knees of Arthur&#x27;s trousers and he rocked back and forth as he sobbed like a child. There was none of the stoicism that he held firmly in place when his knights die, only ugly sobs exploding from his chest and tear streaks forming in Merlin&#x27;s dried blood on his face. &quot;Merlin! Merlin, please !&quot; he half cried half begged. A litany of Merlin spilled from Arthur&#x27;s lips like a prayer. He can&#x27;t see or hear anything anymore; grief blinding him to the world around him. &quot;I love you too, Merlin. I love you so much. Only you. Please, please, please come back to me darling,&quot; he gasps out as his hands desperately clutch at Merlin&#x27;s clothes. Merlin is dead but he doesn&#x27;t feel like it. His skin is not cold and its pale color remains unlike so many bodies Arthur had seen. Merlin is warm and soft in Arthur&#x27;s arms, exactly the way Arthur never got to feel before this very instant. This is not how Arthur had dreamed of holding Merlin. The only thing that gave it away was the terrible limpness that dragged Merlin&#x27;s body down to earth. His head lulled back and forth as Arthur rocked with him and his arms lay uselessly at his sides. This was nothing but a shell of what his love was. His beloved Merlin. Suddenly a great flush of anger filled his chest and he screamed, &quot;No! No this can&#x27;t happen! Merlin wake up! WAKE UP! YOU DON&#x27;T GET TO DIE FOR ME! YOU CAN&#x27;T DIE AND LEAVE ME HERE WITHOUT YOU!&quot; He&#x27;s shaking Merlin&#x27;s shoulders now, willing him to open his stupid blue eyes and make a joke like he always did. There was only silence. Arthur dropped Merlin from his arms and scrambled back across the grass and dirt. He couldn&#x27;t understand what was happening, because Merlin never got hurt. He wasn&#x27;t supposed to get hurt, he was Merlin . Another great wave of sobs overcame his frame and he brought his knees to he chest, burying his face in his knees and hugging his legs. He remembers telling Merlin no man was worth his tears, what a sick and stupid thing to say. Across from him the blood on Merlin&#x27;s body had stopped flowing and was drying on his skin and clothes. Golden light moved inside of him touching his intestines and causing them to mend together like they had always been. Gold touched his skin and the gaping hole of split and curled skin began to heal. The skin unfurled and the muscles underneath knit together. The gold kissed the joints in Merlin&#x27;s elbow and the swelling and tears soothed. The light roamed within his chest and touched his heart like a gentle wind touches flower petals and causes them to stir. Tuh Tump, Tuh Tump, Tuh Tump . Gold curled around his lungs and willed them to contract and expand with oxygen. A great gasp rattled through Merlin&#x27;s chest and the warlock&#x27;s eyes shot open gleaming like the sun itself. His body felt shaky and sore, the clammy sweating that broke throughout his body due more to the shock of being awake than being unwell. Merlin remembered everything that happened, and that&#x27;s why he knew he shouldn&#x27;t be awake right now. He moved his hands to touch his belly. It was sticky with oxidizing blood but there was no wound there to pain him. That&#x27;s when he heard the wracking sobs coming from his right. It was Arthur. Arthur! Before he could give it a second thought he was sitting up and flinging himself toward the prince. They hit the ground hard and Arthur&#x27;s sobs were cut off by panic before he realized who it was. It was Merlin. Merlin with his stupid smile so big he looked crazy and his eyes a brilliant gold. &quot;Merlin!&quot; Arthur cried out before wrapping his arms around his neck and bringing him down for a suffocating hug. The laugh that Merlin let out sounded like the most beautiful song Arthur had ever heard. Merlin held him just as tight and sniffled quietly into his shoulder. &quot;I love you, I love you, I love you,&quot; Arthur serenaded Merlin with the words. He was crying hard again and the words were muddled and he had snot and he couldn&#x27;t care less. Finally Merlin pulled back and Arthur let him but didn&#x27;t let go of his hands. Arthur looked over Merlin&#x27;s body and although it was tough to see through the bloodstains he could tell there was no wound where there should be one. This sent a chill up his spine, but he was pleased that Merlin was okay and the particular implications of the fact it happened weren&#x27;t something he was going to dwell on at the moment. Then Merlin kissed him, and Arthur couldn&#x27;t make a single coherent thought. The kiss was desperate and deep and the taste of iron in Merlin&#x27;s mouth made him shudder and hold him closer. Merlin had died. Arthur would never let that happen again even if it cost him his own life. They stayed in a tight embrace long after they had finished kissing. It wasn&#x27;t until the sun began to dip below the horizon that they parted from their little patch of dirt and grass and blood. The scene around them was truly gruesome. Five bodies lay strewn in the clearing, the two men next to the branch had slipped away at one point. A dark patch of dirt indicated where Merlin had died. The dirt was slick with blood as the earth drank it like water. Arthur couldn&#x27;t look at it anymore. In silence he stood, pulling Merlin by the hand and willing him to get up. With an exhaustion deep in their bones they climbed onto one of the horses that hadn&#x27;t spooked away, it belonged to one of Morgana&#x27;s men. Arthur sat in the front and held the reins as the horse took off. A steady trot was all they could manage in their state and Merlin&#x27;s arms around his torso made his throat go tight. &quot;Gods, Merlin. You&#x27;re alive,&quot; Arthur whispered like it was a secret the fates couldn&#x27;t know. &quot;I told you, Arthur. I would do anything for you.&quot; Merlin pressed a reverent kiss upon Arthur&#x27;s nape. He lay his cheek against Arthur&#x27;s back and held him close. &quot;Never do that again, please,&quot; Arthur begged. &quot;Never again. I promise.&quot; &quot;Stay with me forever,&quot; Arthur breathed. Merlin didn&#x27;t know what forever meant, for him it seemed it could be a reality but whatever forever was for Arthur Merlin knew he would be there. &quot;Of course, my king.&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m the prince.&quot; &quot;You&#x27;re my king,&quot; Merlin said with an affectionate squeeze. The words were much more than just praise and Arthur knew it. They had so much to talk about once they got back to Camelot. &quot;When we get back we are having a long long talk,&quot; Arthur warned, &quot;but first you are going to Gaius and getting every inch of you checked out. You have the next week off and if I see you so much as lifting a finger I&#x27;ll kill you myself.&quot; &quot;You can&#x27;t scare me anymore Arthur,&quot; Merlin teased, &quot;you looove me.&quot; Arthur couldn&#x27;t help the laughed that bubbled up in his chest and this time he didn&#x27;t try to hide it at all. They laughed and laughed in relief until they sounded a bit deranged. They must&#x27;ve been quite a sight crowded on one horse and cackling while covered in blood, but they couldn&#x27;t care less. &quot;Yes I do,&quot; Arthur agreed, &quot;Idiot.&quot; &quot;Prat.&quot; &quot;Dollophead.&quot; &quot;That&#x27;s my word!&quot; Merlin whined and Arthur just snickered. Just like that the once and future king and the most powerful sorcerer made their way through the lush forest surrounding Camelot. Their bickering a more beautiful sound than the songs all the birds sang to them as they passed rejoicing that magic lived on. They were still far from home but they were on the right path in more than one sense as they rode toward Camelot. She belonged to them in every way and someday in the future they would rule over her together. They would unite the land with magic and fierce protection. All of Albion would be united under their tender care and would flourish. Equally as important Merlin and Arthur would flourish just as well and become hero&#x27;s not only to the people but to each other. Forever does come and Merlin is there for all of it holding Arthur&#x27;s hand and keeping his promise. Merlin stays with Arthur forever. End Notes The ending is ambiguous if I do say so myself, what do you think &quot;forever&quot; means?</span> <a href="#" class="summary-toggle">[ + ]</a></div><div class="stats"><div class="stat-item"><strong>Rating:</strong> Teen And Up Audiences</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Archive Warning:</strong> Graphic Depictions Of Violence, Major Character Death</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Category:</strong> M/M</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Fandom:</strong> Merlin (TV)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Relationship:</strong> Merlin/Arthur Pendragon (Merlin), Merlin/Arthur</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Character:</strong> Merlin (Merlin), Arthur Pendragon (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Additional Tags:</strong> Canon-Typical Violence, Alternate Universe - Canon Divergence, Character Death, Magic Revealed, Magic Reveal, Love Confessions, BAMF Merlin, Immortal Merlin, Hurt/Comfort, Angst, Fluff, Fix-It, Angst with a Happy Ending</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Published:</strong> 2019-02-06</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Words:</strong> 4009</div></div></div><div class="work-entry"><h2 class="title"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://download.archiveofourown.org/downloads/5097548/Merlins%20Weekend%20at.pdf?updated_at=1446084499" target="_blank">Merlin&#x27;s Weekend at Arthur&#x27;s</a></h2><div class="summary">Merlin and Arthur have plans for a fun weekend.</div><div class="stats"><div class="stat-item"><strong>Rating:</strong> Teen And Up Audiences</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Archive Warning:</strong> No Archive Warnings Apply</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Category:</strong> M/M</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Fandom:</strong> Merlin (TV)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Relationship:</strong> Merlin/Arthur Pendragon (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Character:</strong> Merlin (Merlin), Arthur Pendragon (Merlin), Freya (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Additional Tags:</strong> Fluff and Angst</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Series:</strong> Part 7 of Merlin and Arthur Live Again</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Collections:</strong> Camelot Drabble -- Prompt #183: Rendezvous</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Published:</strong> 2015-10-28</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Words:</strong> 1051</div></div></div><div class="work-entry"><h2 class="title"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://download.archiveofourown.org/downloads/5147816/Merlins%20Worries%20Arthurs.pdf?updated_at=1474537364" target="_blank">Merlin&#x27;s Worries, Arthur&#x27;s Distractions</a></h2><div class="summary">Magic has been used in Ealdor and Merlin needs a distraction.</div><div class="stats"><div class="stat-item"><strong>Rating:</strong> Teen And Up Audiences</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Archive Warning:</strong> No Archive Warnings Apply</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Category:</strong> F/M, M/M</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Fandom:</strong> Merlin (TV)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Relationship:</strong> Merlin/Arthur Pendragon (Merlin), Leon/Percival (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Character:</strong> Hunith (Merlin), Merlin (Merlin), Arthur Pendragon (Merlin), Gwen (Merlin), Percival (Merlin), Leon (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Additional Tags:</strong> Past Gwen/Arthur Pendragon (Merlin), Modern Era, Magic</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Series:</strong> Part 9 of Merlin and Arthur Live Again</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Collections:</strong> Camelot Drabble -- Prompt #184: Infinite</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Published:</strong> 2015-11-05</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Words:</strong> 1103</div></div></div><div class="work-entry"><h2 class="title"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://download.archiveofourown.org/downloads/44303176/Merthur%20-%20The%20Words%20I.pdf?updated_at=1674338184" target="_blank">Merthur - The Words I Never Said</a></h2><div class="summary"><span class="summary-short">Hostage negotiator Arthur Pendragon and his team are on a godlike trip.

Notes Thanks to my wonderful sister kaseyboy for being my beta again. You&#x27;re the best! This is now my second mute Merlin story. I seem to only be able to write stories with him either being deaf or mute. I don&#x27;t know why. Please forgive any errors I&#x27;ve made about muteness and sign language. I hope you enjoy and comments are greatly appreciated. -- -- Arthur met Merlin through his sister Morgana. Merlin was a graphic designer in the marketing department of Pendragon Industries and Morgana was his boss. He had been working there for nearly a year and everyone, including Uther, was impressed with his work. Arthur was now back in London after having spent the past couple of years traveling for the company. He was VP and would one day run the company once his father, Uther, retired. He hadn&#x27;t minded the traveling until Morgana married Leon, his best friend, about four months ago. He saw how incredibly happy they were together and it made him want more than the life he was leading, coming back to an empty hotel room every night. Arthur wanted someone to keep him in London. He wanted someone to come home to every night and talk to about his day. He wanted to find love. -------- Arthur went down to the cafeteria to grab a quick sandwich for lunch when he saw his sister with a gorgeous young guy. After he remembered to breath, he paid for his food and walked over to where the two were sitting. Before he had a chance to say anything, Morgana saw him. &quot;Arthur, it&#x27;s so nice to see you. Sit down.&quot; After he did she said, &quot;I&#x27;d like to introduce you to Merlin and Merlin, this is my brother Arthur.&quot; Both men smiled at each other and Arthur reached out to shake his hand. When their hands touched, Arthur was afraid he&#x27;d let out an audible gasp. It was like an electric current went up his arm and settled warmly inside his body. It was right after they touched that Arthur discovered Merlin was mute and communicated with sign language. This really wasn&#x27;t a problem for Arthur because he already knew sign since his mother had been deaf. The two became fast friends, which was nice, but Arthur wanted more than just a friendship with Merlin. So after about a month, Arthur asked Merlin out on a date which he quickly accepted. -------- Arthur and Merlin had been dating for four months when they confessed their love for each other. It was that same night that they slept together for the first time and it was magical. Merlin wasn&#x27;t very experienced so Arthur took it nice and slow, being extremely gentle with him. -------- Almost every Thursday night, Arthur and Merlin met up at the pub with their now shared friends Morgana, Leon, Gwen, Lance, Gwaine, Elena and sometimes Percy and Mithian. It was Thursday, a few days after they slept together for the first time, when Arthur texted Merlin during lunch. &quot;Sorry, but I have too much work to get done for this merger, I won&#x27;t be able to go tonight.&quot; &quot;That&#x27;s okay, we&#x27;ll go next week,&quot; Merlin texted back. &quot;No, just because I have to work doesn&#x27;t mean you shouldn&#x27;t go.&quot; Merlin replied with, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to go without you.&quot; &quot;You go and have fun. I&#x27;ll see you tomorrow night at the party.&quot; &quot;Ok but I&#x27;ll miss you.&quot; &quot;I&#x27;ll miss you too. Have fun. Love you,&quot; Arthur texted and when he saw Merlin&#x27;s texted &quot;love you too,&quot; he put his phone down to get back to work. -------- Arthur finished work earlier than expected so he headed straight to the pub to surprise Merlin. When he walked in it was more crowded than usual but after looking around for a minute he spotted Merlin. He smiled to himself but before he had a chance to walk over to him, he watched as Merlin reached up and put his hands on some guy&#x27;s chest as he was pulling Merlin close for a sloppy kiss. Stunned, Arthur&#x27;s eyes narrowed and he turned and walked out of the pub before Merlin or anyone else saw him. What Arthur missed by leaving so quickly was Merlin&#x27;s knee going into the guy&#x27;s groin causing him to let go of him. The bloke that Arthur saw kissing Merlin was Valiant, a guy that also worked at Pendragon Industries but in another department. He was always trying to get Merlin to go out with him but he always refused. Valiant was drunk and still couldn&#x27;t seem to take no for an answer so he forced himself on Merlin. Gwaine and Percy rushed over and shoved him away from Merlin and out of the club and told Valiant to stay away from him. By the time Arthur got to his flat, he was furious. &quot;How could he do this to me,&quot; he kept repeating to himself. He quickly downed several shots before he crawled into bed. He was physically, mentally and emotionally exhausted and fell asleep almost instantly. -------- &quot;how was work. did you get everything done?&quot; Merlin texted Arthur late Friday morning. When Arthur saw the text, he just glared at his phone and was tempted to throw it across his office but he restrained himself. Instead, he just ignored it along with the other three messages he&#x27;d received from Merlin throughout the day. Merlin wasn&#x27;t really too concerned that Arthur didn&#x27;t respond to any of his texts. He knew he had a lot going and was probably just too busy to respond. He knew he&#x27;d see him tonight at the party Uther was throwing for his employees as a thank you for their hard work. It was an annual event and no expense was spared. -------- Morgana stopped into Arthur&#x27;s office in the late afternoon to ask him something about the party but he just brushed her off. &quot;I still have lots of work to do on this merger so if you don&#x27;t mind, I don&#x27;t have time to deal with your little party issues.&quot; &quot;You don&#x27;t have to be such an arse,&quot; she said back as she left his office and slammed the door shut behind her. He wasn&#x27;t really busy, he had finished the work last night but he was pissed at her for not bothering to tell him that Merlin was cheating on him. He was her brother, she should have told him. -------- Arthur and Merlin had previously agreed to meet at the banquet hall that Uther always reserved for the occasion because Uther expected him and Morgana to be there well in advance of anyone else. The siblings managed to avoid each other, which really wasn&#x27;t too difficult considering the fact that Morgana was still angry at Arthur from earlier in the day and Arthur was obviously furious with her. Arthur was already at the bar when Merlin showed up. He didn&#x27;t see Arthur right away but Arthur saw him and moved over to talk to Cendred, a bloke he&#x27;d dated a few years ago. Merlin was soon greeted by Morgana. &quot;Have you seen Arthur?&quot; he signed to her. &quot;No, but I really haven&#x27;t looked for him. I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;s around here somewhere,&quot; she said as they both scanned the crowd. &quot;Oh, there he is, at the bar.&quot; As Merlin approached Arthur, he heard him talking to Cendred. &quot;So how&#x27;s the little boyfriend?&quot; Cendred asked sarcastically. &quot;Who, Merlin?&quot; &quot;Yeah.&quot; &quot;That&#x27;s totally over. I got what I wanted and now I&#x27;m done with him,&quot; he said loud enough so Merlin could hear. Merlin stopped dead in his tracks. He couldn&#x27;t believe what Arthur was saying. Arthur turned around and glared at Merlin as he said to Cendred, &quot;why, you interested?&quot; &quot;Hell yeah,&quot; and he slid closer to Arthur who pulled him flush against himself and started giving Cendred open mouthed kisses as he looked Merlin directly in the eyes. Merlin was frozen to the spot as the tears started to pool in his eyes. He needed to get out of there now. He turned and rushed to the loo since it was closer than the exit. He went into a stall so he could try to gather his composure before anyone saw him. Unfortunately, he was spotted by Valiant who quickly followed him into the loo. Arthur watched Valiant follow Merlin, which pissed him off even more. Obviously Merlin&#x27;s &quot;other boyfriend&quot; was going in to comfort him. He pushed Cendred away and left without saying anything to anyone. Merlin didn&#x27;t hear Valiant enter because he was trying to get his breathing under control and fighting to stop the tears. As he opened the stall door, Valiant pushed his way into the stall with Merlin. &quot;So Merlin, we meet again,&quot; he sneered. He was still furious about the night before when Merlin kneed him in the groin. Merlin was in a panic. He had to get out of the stall and away but before he could even start to fight back, Valiant punched him in the face. This was quickly followed by more blows to the face and several to the ribs before he managed to turn Merlin around and shove him against the side of the stall face first. Before he could go any farther, Gwaine walked in. Gwaine didn&#x27;t know who was in the stall but he saw blood on the floor and heard struggling so he kicked the door in which knocked Valiant off Merlin. Merlin fell to the floor now that there was nothing holding him up. Gwaine pulled Valiant out of the stall and yelled for help. Thankfully, Percy was heading to the loo and rushed in. As he saw Gwaine fighting Valiant, he grabbed him from behind and yanked Valiant&#x27;s arm high up behind his back as he put his other arm around his neck before he saw Merlin laying on the floor of the stall. Gwaine rushed over to him and fell to his knees. &quot;Merlin, Merlin, are you okay?! Merlin! Wake up!&quot; He was panicked so Percy kept his hold on Valiant as he shoved him out the door so he could yell for more help. Two security guards came and took Valiant from Percy and called the cops. By this time, all Merlin&#x27;s friends had filled the loo and everyone in the banquet hall knew something terrible had happened. Merlin finally woke up much to his friend&#x27;s great relief and Gwaine and Leon were able to get him up. &quot;We need to get him to the hospital,&quot; Leon said. &quot;Where&#x27;s Arthur?&quot; Morgana asked but no one was able to answer because no one knew where he&#x27;d disappeared to. She rushed out ahead of them to get to her car. Leon and Gwaine led Merlin outside and to Morgana&#x27;s car, which she had at the curb waiting for them. She was on the phone leaving Arthur a message as Gwaine and Leon slowly climbed in the back with Merlin. Everyone inside the hall was shocked and sickened after not only knowing it was Merlin that had been attacked but seeing his bruised and bloody body being helped out by his friends. -------- Morgana and everyone else tried to get in touch with Arthur once they were at the hospital but their calls just kept going straight to voice mail. They were all unaware of the fact that Arthur left the party to go home where he proceeded to get drunk. After the first call he got from Morgana, Arthur turned off his phone without even listening to it. Morgana left him a second message telling him to &quot;call as soon as you get this. Merlin has been hurt. We&#x27;re at the hospital.&quot; From Leon: &quot;Hey man, I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing but call Morgana or me when you get this message.&quot; From Gwaine: &quot;Listen you arse, Merlin&#x27;s hurt and needs you. Where the fuck are you?!&quot; From Morgana: &quot;Arthur why the fuck aren&#x27;t you answering your phone! Call me back!&quot; The friends also tried texting Arthur. Morgana: Call me now!!!!!! Gwaine: where the fuck r u !! Leon: Arthur we took Merlin to A&amp;E. Come as soon as you can Morgana: get your fucking ass over here. Merlin needs you Gwaine: FUCK YOU PENDRAGON -------- Merlin was admitted to the hospital and taken to surgery to repair the broken jaw he suffered. He also had a concussion caused by Valiant slamming his head against the wall of the stall and several cracked ribs. As soon as he was out of surgery and moved to a private room, thanks to Morgana, Leon went to Arthur&#x27;s flat since no one had heard from him yet. -------- Arthur woke up to pounding on his door at six in the morning. He could hear Leon yelling something but he put his pillow over his head and fell back to sleep because his head was pounding. When Leon told Morgana that Arthur never answered his door, they both were worried that something had happened to him. -------- Around ten in the morning, Arthur once again heard someone banging on his door. He then heard Morgana&#x27;s voice yelling at him to open the door. He managed to get out of bed long enough to yell at her to &quot;fuck off&quot; before he crawled back in bed. He was quite sure she was there to bitch at him for making Merlin cry and he didn&#x27;t want to hear it from his traitor sister. She was furious with him but relieved to know that he was at least okay. She&#x27;d deal with him later but right now she needed to be with Merlin. No one else knocked on Arthur&#x27;s door for the rest of the weekend. Saturday night, when he finally turned his phone back on, the first text he saw was from Gwaine, &quot;FUCK YOU PENDRAGON&quot; so he deleted it plus the rest of his texts and voice mails without reading or listening to them. How dare Merlin involve their friends and have them harass him. -------- Monday morning when Arthur showed up at work he got a few surprised looks from people but no one approached him. He was still angry with Merlin and his friends and apparently the scowl he wore on his face made everyone avoid him. He spent the morning locked in his office. When he left to go to lunch he was stopped by several people asking him how Merlin was doing. Arthur and Merlin hadn&#x27;t flaunted their relationship but he knew people were aware of it. He was annoyed that everyone seemed so concerned about Merlin just because of what Arthur had done Friday night. They obviously didn&#x27;t know what their beloved Merlin had done to him the night before so his response was either, &quot;how should I know,&quot; or &quot;I don&#x27;t really care.&quot; Each of which brought looks of shock or anger or disgust. When he returned from lunch, he got more of the same questions so he stormed straight to Morgana&#x27;s office. When he got there, her PA told him she took the day off and then told him she was surprised he was there. &quot;And why wouldn&#x27;t I be here today,&quot; he demanded. &quot;I just figured, with everything that happened, you&#x27;d be at the hospital,&quot; the PA said. &quot;I have no idea what you&#x27;re talking about. Why would I be at the hospital?&quot; &quot;Well, I thought since Merlin was there, you&#x27;d...&quot; but she stopped herself before she said anymore fearing it could end up getting her fired. Arthur stormed back to his office where he slammed his door shut before he called Morgana. After six rings, she finally answered. &quot;Where are you and what the hell is going on?!&quot; &quot;Oh Arthur, so nice of you to finally call,&quot; she said with such fake sweetness it just angered him more. &quot;What the hell is going on?!&quot; &quot;Oh, so you want to act like you&#x27;re interested now?&quot; &quot;Morgana, tell me what&#x27;s going on,&quot; he growled. &quot;Well, let&#x27;s see. Merlin got through surgery and they should be releasing him soon.&quot; &quot;What the fuck are you talking about? Why did he have surgery? Where are you?&quot; &quot;Sorry, but I can&#x27;t talk anymore. The doctor&#x27;s coming.&quot; She hung up leaving him worried and confused and feeling sick. He still had no idea what was going on so he called Leon. &quot;Leon, please tell me what&#x27;s going on,&quot; he rushed out almost in a panic. &quot;Well hello to you too Arthur,&quot; Leon snapped because he was angry at Arthur&#x27;s lack of concern for Merlin. Arthur knew it must be something bad if Leon was talking to him like that. &quot;Leon, please, I just want to know what&#x27;s going on,&quot; he pleaded. &quot;Friday night Merlin was attacked by Valiant in the loo. He really did a number on him. He broke his jaw, cracked several ribs and gave him a concussion,&quot; he told him sadly. &quot;No,&quot; Arthur whispered. &quot;They had to do surgery on his jaw that night but Morgana told me a short time ago that they were going to release him from the hospital today, which is good. He looks like shit though. When I saw him last night, the swelling in his left eye still hadn&#x27;t gone down much. His lip is still swollen and he&#x27;s probably going to have a scar or two from where Valiant&#x27;s ring sliced into him. He&#x27;s really sore and having trouble moving because of his ribs but other than that, he&#x27;s fine,&quot; he finished sarcastically. Arthur collapsed in his chair trying to just breath. &#x27;This can&#x27;t be happening,&#x27; he said to himself. Finally, he gathered his composure enough to ask Leon what hospital he was in before he rushed out of his office. By the time he got to the hospital, Merlin had already been released. He assumed Morgana probably took Merlin back to his own flat, not really thinking, so he rushed there. After spending several minutes banging on Merlin&#x27;s door, he realized Morgana must have taken him somewhere else so he called her. &quot;Morgana, where is he?&quot; he demanded. &quot;No, I&#x27;m not telling you. The last thing he needs right now is to get upset so just stay away from him. I think you&#x27;ve done more than enough damage as it is,&quot; she said before she hung up. Arthur sat in his car and put his head on the steering wheel and cried. Merlin was hurt and even though he was cheating on him, he still needed to see him so he went to Morgana&#x27;s. She wasn&#x27;t there so he just sat outside her door to wait until she returned. It was around five when she finally showed up looking tired. &quot;What are you doing here?&quot; she asked him as she unlocked her door and went inside. &quot;I need to see him, please,&quot; Arthur said as he followed her in. &quot;No, I don&#x27;t think you do. I believe you hurt him enough already by making out with Cendred right in front of him.&quot; &quot;I was only doing that to get even with him.&quot; &quot;Get even with him for what?!&quot; &quot;For cheating on me and don&#x27;t even try to act like you don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m talking about.&quot; &quot;I have no fucking idea what you&#x27;re talking about?!&quot; she yelled as Leon walked into the flat. &quot;I saw him all over some guy at the pub!&quot; Arthur shouted. &quot;What are you talking about?!&quot; she yelled again. &quot;Oh come on Morgana, I saw him!&quot; &quot;When!&quot; &quot;Thursday night, as soon as I finished with work, I went to the pub and saw him and some guy all over each other. It was really nice of you and Leon to not tell me my boyfriend was cheating on me!&quot; &quot;Oh my god, are you kidding me?!&#x27;&#x27; She knew instantly what he was talking about. &quot;Did you also happen to see Merlin knee him in the groin to make him let him go?! Oh, and, by the way, that was Valiant, the same guy that beat him up Friday.&quot; &quot;What?&quot; &quot;He wanted to get revenge on Merlin for what he did to him on Thursday night.&quot; &quot;But...no! I saw him follow Merlin into the loo on Friday. I just thought he was going in there to...No! Oh my god! I watched him go in there so he could hurt Merlin and I just let him.&quot; He fell to the floor and sobbed knowing he could have prevented the whole thing. Morgana kneeled down beside him and put her arms around him. &quot;Arthur, you were an idiot but you had no idea Valiant was going to hurt Merlin. You can&#x27;t blame yourself for that.&quot; When Arthur got himself under control, the brother and sister stood up and sat on the sofa. A minute later Leon came in with three cups of tea. They all sat there in silence until Arthur finally asked, &quot;where is he?&quot; &quot;Listen, if I tell you, you have to promise you won&#x27;t go see him, at least not right now.&quot; &quot;No, I have to see him. I have to make sure he&#x27;s okay for myself. I have to tell him how sorry I am. Please Morgana.&quot; Morgana looked over at Leon and he gave her a small nod. &quot;Okay, but listen, I&#x27;m going to go with you and if Merlin doesn&#x27;t want to see you then you have to promise you&#x27;ll leave.&quot; &quot;I promise.&quot; -------- Morgana drove Arthur to Gwen and Lance&#x27;s flat. &#x27;Of course,&#x27; he thought to himself. He should have known that was where Merlin would be. Before Morgana left, she had whispered to Leon to call Gwen to warn them that they were coming over. She wanted Gwen to be able to talk to Merlin and check if he wanted to see Arthur or not. As soon as Gwen answered the door, she told them Merlin was sleeping, which he was because of the pain medication he was on. &quot;Can I go and see him? I promise I won&#x27;t wake him,&quot; Arthur asked quietly. &quot;Go on, he&#x27;s in the guest room,&quot; Gwen told him. -------- Arthur slowly pushed the guest room door open. The room was fairly dark because the blinds were closed but even in the dim light, he could see Merlin&#x27;s battered face and it knocked the breath right out of him. It took a minute before he was able to walk into the room. The light from the hall landed on Merlin&#x27;s face which made it possible for him to see the bruises, cuts and swelling more clearly and it made him nauseous. He just looked down at Merlin&#x27;s abused face while tears streamed down his cheeks. Finally, he kneeled by the side of the bed and reached out to hold Merlin&#x27;s hand. With his other hand he very gently moved Merlin&#x27;s hair off his forehead and leaned up and kissed it tenderly. That kiss was followed by many more gentle kisses to all the injuries on his face. &quot;I&#x27;m so sorry Merlin. I&#x27;m so so sorry. I love you so much. I just hope you&#x27;ll be able to forgive me some day.&quot; He then rested his head on the side of the bed never releasing Merlin&#x27;s hand and cried. Arthur didn&#x27;t know that Gwen and Morgana were outside the room and witnessed the tenderness he displayed towards Merlin. They finally walked away to give him some privacy. Merlin never woke up while Arthur was sitting with him which he was both grateful for and sad about. He wanted to tell him how sorry he was and how much he loved him but he was afraid of the reaction Merlin would have from seeing him. After a few hours he got up and left the room asking Gwen if he could come back and see him in the morning. &quot;I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a very good idea. Just give me time to talk to him first,&quot; Gwen told him. &quot;Okay, but can I call you in the morning to check on him?&quot; &quot;Of course.&quot; Morgana had already left so he went outside and walked around for a while before he called a cab to take him home. -------- Arthur didn&#x27;t get to see Merlin at all that whole week. Gwen tried to spare his feelings by telling him that Merlin didn&#x27;t want to see anyone. Arthur knew it was just him that Merlin didn&#x27;t want to see because Morgana was keeping him updated on his progress. She told him he was still in a lot of pain and was getting antsy and wanted to go back to his own flat and back to work but the doctors wanted him to take another week off. Actually, Morgana was keeping everyone updated by sending the staff daily emails regarding Merlin. She said it was much easier doing it that way because she was repeatedly being stopped throughout the day by coworkers wanting to know how Merlin was. After Monday, no one had wasted their time asking Arthur how Merlin was. He assumed word of his initial replies to those inquiries on Monday had spread and now they all probably thought he was a heartless bastard. -------- The second week was much the same as the first. Gwen would come up with some excuse or another as to why he couldn&#x27;t see Merlin. Arthur sent him a text each day but never got a reply back. He also sent flowers and even talked to a doctor to see what kinds of foods Merlin could eat and then had that delivered to him. -------- Merlin finally returned to work the following Monday. Arthur wanted to go see him but it was like a zoo around him most of the day with coworkers coming to see him to tell him how glad they were that he was back and how much they missed him. Arthur stayed in the background and watched as people would smile as soon as they spotted him, which made Arthur&#x27;s heart warm knowing so many people cared about and adored Merlin. When he finally got a clear view of him, Arthur saw that the swelling and bruising was almost totally gone. He still had a bandage covering up the stitches he had on his chin and cheek and was moving slowly but he looked happy to be back. Tuesday, Arthur went down to Merlin&#x27;s department just before lunch hoping to catch him alone. When Merlin spotted him, he quickly put his head down and acted busy. It was clear that this wasn&#x27;t going to be easy. &quot;Hey, how&#x27;re you feeling?&quot; Arthur asked him. &quot;Better,&quot; Merlin signed back without making any eye contact with him. &quot;I&#x27;m glad. Um, do you think we could go somewhere and talk?&quot; Arthur asked hesitantly. Merlin shook his head no then signed, &quot;I&#x27;ve got a lot of work to get caught up on.&quot; &quot;Oh, okay. I guess I&#x27;ll let you get back to it then.&quot; As he turned to walk away, he added, &quot;I&#x27;m really glad you&#x27;re back,&quot; and then left. Once Arthur was back in his own office, he shut the door, sat down and put his head in his hands. He felt like crying knowing Merlin didn&#x27;t want anything to do with him. After Arthur left him, Merlin slowly made his way to the loo so he could try to regain his composure. It was so hard seeing Arthur and he hadn&#x27;t been ready for it. Arthur continued to make attempts to talk to Merlin but he wasn&#x27;t successful. -------- Three months had passed since Arthur broke Merlin&#x27;s heart and he was desperate to talk to him so he went to Morgana to ask if he could join them for their weekly pub night. She didn&#x27;t give him an answer right away because she wanted to check with Merlin to see if he was alright with the idea. After she&#x27;d talked to Merlin, she told Arthur it&#x27;d be okay if he came. ------- Over the next several weeks, Arthur slowly started trying to engage Merlin in conversations. They started off with small talk and one word answers but at least it was a start and Arthur could feel the ice beginning to melt just the tiniest bit between them. On one of their weekly trips to the pub, Arthur watched as a bloke came over to Merlin and tried to talk to him but Merlin just shook his head and tried to walk away. The guy then grabbed Merlin by the shoulder and swung him around roughly but before it went any farther than that, Arthur was there between the two of them shoving the man away from Merlin. After they exchanged a few words, the man left and Arthur turned around to face Merlin. &quot;Are you okay? Did he hurt you?&quot; Arthur asked. Merlin shook his head no but looked a little shaken so Arthur put his arm on the small of Merlin&#x27;s back and led him back over to their table. When Merlin sat down, Arthur took the seat beside him. They were both quieter than normal after that but if their friends noticed, no one mentioned it. When Merlin was getting ready to leave for the night, he gave Arthur a sad smile and signed thanks. Arthur wasn&#x27;t about to let him walk out of the pub alone because he didn&#x27;t know where the guy from earlier was and he wasn&#x27;t willing to risk Merlin&#x27;s safety. As Merlin was standing, he noticed Arthur stand also. When he looked at Arthur giving him a questioning look, Arthur just grinned and shrugged his shoulders and walked out with Merlin and led him over to a taxi to ensure he made it home safely. Merlin gave him a small wave which he returned before heading back inside the pub to rejoin their friends. Merlin had a hard time falling asleep that night. He kept replaying the events of the night over and over in his head. He could almost still feel the warmth of Arthur&#x27;s hand on his back. He was so confused. He thought he was getting over Arthur but now he was doubting that. Maybe he had just been fooling himself all this time thinking he was getting over him. -------- Merlin missed their next couple weeks of pub nights. He told Morgana it was because he had a lot of things he needed to get caught up on but Arthur secretly thought it had more to do with what happened with their last encounter. Arthur had stayed away from Merlin at work per Morgana&#x27;s request but he had at least that one night a week where he could see and try to talk to Merlin but with his absence, Arthur was going crazy. He missed Merlin so much. -------- Gwen was having a party to celebrate Lance&#x27;s birthday. It was a large gathering outside their building in the patio area with lots of people Arthur didn&#x27;t know. Arthur spotted Merlin off to the side signing with Owen, a guy from work. Arthur was concerned that maybe he and Merlin had gotten together so he sought Gwen out. Before he could find her, a blonde bloke approached him and put his arm over his shoulder before whispering in his ear asking him to dance. Arthur removed the guy&#x27;s arm as he shook his head and continued his search for Gwen. Unbeknownst to him, Merlin had been watching the encounter and grinned to himself when he saw Arthur walk away from he guy. When Arthur finally located Gwen, she explained that, no, Merlin and Owen weren&#x27;t together, just friends. Arthur let out a deep sigh of relief. Gwen gave him a small smile and patted him on the arm before she returned to her other guests. She and the rest of their friends had finally forgiven him for hurting Merlin. When Arthur next saw Merlin, he was standing off to the side watching people dancing to a slow song with such a sadness and longing in his eyes that it broke Arthur&#x27;s heart. He walked up to Merlin and asked, &quot;will you dance with me?&quot; Merlin looked at him with sad eyes and shook his head no before he looked down to the floor. Arthur wasn&#x27;t about to give up so easily. He hesitantly reached out and lifted Merlin&#x27;s chin to get him to look at him. &quot;Please,&quot; he mouthed as he was giving Merlin puppy dog eyes. Merlin hesitated and Arthur took advantage of his indecision and again asked, &quot;pretty please?&quot; This drew a grin out of Merlin. Arthur slowly reached out and took his hand as he looked at him more serious this time. &quot;Please,&quot; he said again looking so hopeful, Merlin finally relented and allowed Arthur to lead him over, but off to the side, of where everyone was dancing. When Arthur pulled Merlin into him, like he had done so many times before, it felt right. Oh how he had longed to have this back. He held on to Merlin like his life depended on it. Before he even realized it, he had tears running down his cheeks and soaking into Merlin&#x27;s shoulder. Merlin pulled back a little and looked at Arthur&#x27;s face. He slowly lifted his hands and gently wiped the tears off his cheeks with his fingers and gave him another sad smile. Arthur pulled him close again not wanting to give up the closeness. He was relieved Merlin let him. Before either of them had even realized it, twenty minutes had passed and the people that were still dancing were now jumping around to the song now playing while they were still clinging to each other just swaying in each other&#x27;s arms. Finally, Merlin started to pull away a little which brought Arthur back to reality. He looked at Merlin and gave him a sheepish grin before he released his hold on Merlin and then led him away from the dance floor keeping his hand on Merlin&#x27;s back. When they reached the other side of the patio area, Arthur asked him if he&#x27;d like a beer and when Merlin nodded yes, he left to fetch them both one before returning to Merlin. Arthur knew their friends were secretly watching them but was thankful no one came over to interfere. Arthur handed Merlin his beer before he asked, &quot;can we please talk? There&#x27;s so much I need to say to you.&quot; Merlin looked at him nervously. He didn&#x27;t know if he was ready to be alone with Arthur and listen to what he had to say yet. But Arthur&#x27;s next &quot;please&quot; broke any remaining resistance he had. Arthur led him up to Gwen and Lance&#x27;s flat. He didn&#x27;t want any interruptions so he took him to their guest room so they&#x27;d have privacy if someone else came into the flat. When they reached the spare room, Arthur led Merlin over to the bed to sit and put both their beers on the dresser. He then kneeled down in front of Merlin so he could see him clearly. &quot;I am so so sorry I hurt you. There is absolutely no excuse for what I did. There is no way you could hate me more than I hate myself. I love you so much. I know I have no right to ask this of you, but can you ever forgive me?&quot; Merlin looked at him for a minute before he signed, &quot;I can forgive you in time but I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll be able to forget what I heard you say and what I saw you do.&quot; He now had tears running down his face. &quot;I thought you loved me but then you said and did those things.&quot; Arthur tried to respond but Merlin waved him off and continued. &quot;I always thought you were out of my league and I couldn&#x27;t believe you would ever be interested in me, but then, the longer we were together, I started to believe it was real and that maybe you did love me. Then when I heard you say you got what you wanted and was done with me, I felt so stupid and humiliated.&quot; He had to stop to wipe his eyes of their tears. &quot;You used me and made me feel dirty and worthless. I loved you more than anything and then you did that to me. You got what you wanted and then just threw me away like a piece of trash.&quot; Arthur couldn&#x27;t take it anymore. He reached up and held Merlin&#x27;s hands to still them before he spoke. &quot;Oh my god Merlin, please, I love you so much. I swear I wasn&#x27;t using you. Please, you have to believe me. You mean more to me than life itself. I am so so sorry. I would do anything to be able to turn back time and erase what I did.&quot; &quot;Why did you do it then?&quot; he signed. Morgana had already told him how Arthur had misinterpreted what he&#x27;d seen that Thursday night with Valiant in the pub but all Morgana knew was that Arthur had kissed Cendred right in front of Merlin. She only knew that much because other people had witnessed it and told her about it. She didn&#x27;t know anything about what Arthur said to him because Merlin had never told her or anyone else because he was too embarrassed and humiliated. &quot;That night, I went to find you at the pub because I finished work early. When I walked in, I thought you were kissing Valiant...&quot; &#x27;But I wasn&#x27;t. I would never do that to you.&quot; &quot;I know that but, at that moment, I just was so angry and jealous, I lost it. I wanted to hurt you the same way I was hurting.&quot; Arthur looked down at the floor for a minute before looking back up at Merlin. &quot;I&#x27;m so sorry. You are the most important thing in the world to me. I&#x27;m willing to do anything to get you back. I love you so much.&quot; He was crying by this time and leaned over to rest his head against Merlin&#x27;s knee. Finally, he felt fingers running through his hair and after a minute of savoring the feel of it, he hesitantly pulled back and looked up at Merlin who signed, &quot;I don&#x27;t know if I can trust you again. You broke my heart. How do I know you won&#x27;t do it again?&quot; &quot;I swear to you I will never hurt you again. I would rather die than cause you any more pain. Please believe me.&quot; When Merlin made no response, Arthur continued, &quot;I love you Merlin and I will do anything it takes to get you to trust me again and to prove to you that I do love you.&quot; Merlin still didn&#x27;t respond. He just stared at Arthur fighting an internal battle with himself. Part of him really wanted to believe Arthur but the other part just kept replaying the words Arthur had spoken to him that night. &quot;Can we try again? Please?&quot; Arthur signed. Merlin looked at him and saw the sincerity in his eyes and signed, &quot;maybe we can try being friends.&quot; It wasn&#x27;t what Arthur was hoping for but it was so much better than it could have been so he counted it as a small victory. He stood up and then pulled Merlin up and into his arms. He knew he might be pushing it but he just had to feel him in his arms again. Merlin didn&#x27;t seem to mind the closeness either because he relaxed into the hug. ------ A few months after Lance&#x27;s birthday party, Merlin and Arthur were friends again. Arthur wanted more but Merlin just couldn&#x27;t get over his trust issues with Arthur so whenever Arthur broached the subject of them going on a date, Merlin declined. Arthur was determined not to lose hope, after all, he was the cause of this. He patiently waited for the day Merlin would be able to look at him and not see him as the man that had broken his heart, but instead, as the man who was willing to wait for him no matter how long it took. Over the following months, he sat back and waited. He knew Merlin was his soul mate and even though it killed him not to be able to hold or kiss him, he held onto the belief and hope that one day soon, Merlin would realize that too. It took nearly six months for Merlin to finally see that man. Arthur hadn&#x27;t pushed but he had been there making Merlin laugh, buying him coffee and then surprising him by delivering it to his desk, showing up at his flat with take-out when he knew Merlin had had a bad day and he&#x27;d most likely forget to eat, offering him support and a shoulder to cry on when his Mum was very ill and in the hospital. He was also there when Merlin went to the store to buy a new suit for Gwen and Lance&#x27;s wedding. He helped pick out a shirt that showed off his beautiful eyes. When Merlin came out of the dressing room, Arthur was standing there with a tie for him to try on but, instead of handing it to Merlin to put on himself, he stepped close to Merlin, flipped his collar up, reached around him to grab the other end of the tie before he carefully tied it just right. When he reached up to flip the collar back down, he didn&#x27;t remove his hands. He looked deep into Merlin&#x27;s eyes and moved his hands just enough so he could gently stroke Merlin&#x27;s cheekbones. When Merlin took a startled gasp but didn&#x27;t pull away, Arthur leaned in and pressed his lips to Merlin&#x27;s. He pulled back a few inches but when Merlin made no attempt to retreat, he cupped his face in his hands and kissed him like it was the only thing that would keep him alive. He didn&#x27;t realize until they broke apart that they both had tears streaming down their faces. He gave Merlin a warm smile as he carefully wipes the tears from his face and then pulled him in for another kiss that ended with them just holding each other in the middle of the dressing area. When they parted, they looked at each other and they had matching grins on their faces. Arthur smoothed down Merlin&#x27;s shirt before he stepped back and looked him up and down, &quot;you look absolutely gorgeous. Merlin, will you be my date for the wedding?&quot; Merlin smiled even brighter and nodded yes. Arthur pulled him in for another hug and ended with a quick kiss before Merlin turned and retreated back into the dressing rooms. Arthur felt like he was floating on air. He wanted to shout at the top of his lungs and throw his arms in the air proclaiming victory. He had just won the best prize in the world, Merlin. As soon as Merlin emerged with his clothes, Arthur took them up to the counter and told the shop assistant they&#x27;d be back later in the week to pick everything up after the alterations were complete. He then lead Merlin outside where he couldn&#x27;t help himself. There, in the middle of the street, he pulled him in for another kiss and hug. Once they&#x27;d broken apart, Arthur whispered, &quot;I love you so much.&quot; He would&#x27;ve loved more than anything to drop down on one knee and propose to Merlin right then and there but he knew it was too soon. He did know that it would happen this time though. He was never letting go of Merlin again. In the weeks leading up to the wedding, Merlin and Arthur started going on real dates. Arthur would pick him up and take him to dinner. Merlin was still a little apprehensive so Arthur was more than willing to take it slow for Merlin. They decided not to tell their friends just yet. They wanted to wait until after the wedding because they didn&#x27;t want to take any attention away from Gwen and Lance as their big day approached. Arthur and Merlin sat beside each other during the wedding ceremony. Arthur reached over ever so slyly to hold Merlin&#x27;s hand. At the reception, they danced together a few times but not enough to make anyone suspicious. The week after the newlyweds returned from their honeymoon, Arthur and Merlin showed up to the weekly pub night hand in hand with matching smiles on their faces. Their friends looked at them and broke into cheers before pulling them into hugs. -------- Six months later, Arthur was once again outside a dressing room standing in front of Merlin, tying a bow tie for him this time. He gave him a passionate kiss and then smoothed down Merlin&#x27;s shirt before he stepped back and looked him up and down. &quot;You look absolutely gorgeous,&quot; he told him. This time, Merlin was standing in front of him in the tuxedo he&#x27;d be wearing in less than a month to their own wedding. Arthur had never been happier. Merlin accepted his proposal after they were dating for less than five months and here they were, less than a month away from their wedding day. It had been a long bumpy road that Arthur had to travel down to regain Merlin&#x27;s trust but he&#x27;d finally made it to the end. Arthur knew what it was like to lose his precious Merlin, now that he had him once again, he was going to cherish and love him for the rest of his life. -------- Six years, one flat and one house later, Arthur and Merlin were in the park. Merlin was running around playing with their three-year-old daughter Freya and her new puppy. Arthur watched them from the picnic blanket they&#x27;d spread out under a tree and realized he was the luckiest man alive. Every morning, when he woke with Merlin in his arms, he couldn&#x27;t help but think that he almost lost this forever and he&#x27;d hold onto him a little bit longer and a little bit tighter. Then he&#x27;d think about his daughter and what he would&#x27;ve missed out on without Merlin&#x27;s forgiveness so he&#x27;d hold on just a little bit longer and a little bit tighter still. The end.

As his manservant takes care of his wounds, secrets that have been long hidden are unveiled within the walls of the royal chambers to test the real measure of love. Notes Hi there! Please note that this was scheduled to be posted on New Year’s Eve, but things got messy :) enjoy! See the end of the work for more notes The bloodstained cloth fell from Merlin’s shaky hand again and he bent down to pick it up and dip it in the water-filled bowl on Arthur’s bedside. Arthur was sitting on the edge of his bed with his shirt off while Merlin took care of the fresh wound on his right shoulder. Goosebumps covered his masculine arms from how chilly the air was in his chambers, and the longer Merlin took to clean the gash, the colder he grew. He was tired and his whole body ached from having been riding almost all day. As for the injury he stared down at as he waited for Merlin to resume, he didn’t know how he’d managed to get back here without any other ones. It was the last day of the year which meant that Arthur had to go on one of those traditional quests where his fighting and leadership skills were tested. He had to go on his own without any men, even Merlin. Arthur vividly remembers how Merlin hated these customs and wished that they never existed. There was not a time when he left without Merlin trying to talk him out of going. He knew that the reason behind every argument was good. No matter how hard Merlin tried to hide it, Arthur could see how worried he seemed every time he brought up this talk. But this time, it was really getting out of hand. “Merlin, I’m fine .” Arthur slightly shrugged his shoulders to prove his words, but he ended up only moving his good shoulder. Merlin didn’t respond, instead his eyes only flickered to meet Arthur’s before he sat on his knees so he could be closer to the cut he was cleaning. “Merlin.” Arthur called again, this time a bit softer. “Hold still.” he quietly said, still avoiding his gaze as he focused on his work. His voice was faint, which tugged at Arthur’s heart. Merlin’s hand twitched, accidentally grazing Arthur’s sensitive skin. He flinched at the sudden sting of pain, but he was quick enough to catch Merlin’s hand that instantly pulled away as soon as that happened. His grip was soft yet firm enough not to let Merlin’s hand slip out of his. “What’s wrong?” Arthur sincerely asked. He expected a fiery comeback from him, but he was met with silence. He was still refusing to meet his eyes, doing a good job at turning his head in every direction except Arthur’s. “Merlin.” Arthur repeated, letting go of his hand only to place the tips of his fingers right under Merlin’s chin to raise his head up. He let out a low breath at the sight of Merlin’s teary eyes. “You got lucky today.” Merlin whispered. “This is my life, Merlin.” Arthur said, hating how shaken up Merlin looked. “As a prince, a warrior..” he sighed, letting his hand fall into his lap. “Even when I become king. I can’t escape who I am, and you should have become used to it by now.” “No, do not ask me to ever get used to this.” he shook his head. “I can’t.” He didn’t give Arthur a chance to say something before he continued. “What if you hadn’t returned back? What if something had happened to you out there and you couldn’t make it? How would I have--” “Merlin,” Arthur held his hand, interrupting him. “ Nothing happened, you can stop worrying now.” His shoulders relaxed after Arthur held his hand and when he spoke, his voice came out calmer than before. “I have never been this worried before.” “Then why are you this worried?” he asked. “Because,” he stopped mid-way, as if he was having second thoughts about what he was going to say. Arthur gave his hand a light squeeze, urging him to speak. “I have never loved someone this much.” Arthur’s lips curved in an endearing smile, his heart swelling at the words of his manservant. His servant whom he had known for being a clumsy dollophead who could barely find his backside on his best days. Whom he would joke about and playfully insult whenever he had the chance to, and even bickered with more times than he could count. “Well, I can assure you that,” he pulled Merlin’s hand up and rested it on his chest, right over his heart. “This heart will never stop beating before it comes back to you.” and with that, a tear rolled down the young man’s cheek. Arthur had never felt the comfort he felt every time when Merlin was around. He found happiness in their daily banters. He found warmth in Merlin’s wide grin whenever Arthur did something that made him smile. So, he knew that his heart belonged to only one person, and that person was sitting in front of him. “How can you be so sure?” Merlin asked, hesitantly pulling away his hand. “About your feelings, I mean.” Arthur didn’t like the lack of warmth he felt in the absence of Merlin’s hand over his chest. Also the idea of him having doubts about Arthur’s feelings towards him didn’t leave him feeling pleasant in any way. He sensed that Merlin had something else to say; something he had been struggling with, long before today. He cleared his throat, “I don’t know what might be going in your mind right now,” he started. “But I can be myself around you, Merlin. And for me, there’s no higher form of love.” And it was true. Merlin was the only one who could see Arthur for whom he truly is. He has seen him at all times, in all his states, good or bad. He was the only person whom Arthur trusted and… loved . It felt foreign, admitting it to himself and to Merlin, but it wasn’t a bad type of foreign. It was good. Good enough to make him worry more that Merlin’s reaction didn’t change even after Arthur assured him that he, too, feels the same way. “But I can’t.” Merlin whispered. His lips trembled with pent up emotions that he struggled to hold in and Arthur’s heart sank. He had a feeling about where this was going. Merlin stood up and turned his back to him. He watched as he raised both of his hands to wipe his face with the sleeves of his blue tunic. Arthur could feel the tension around them in the air as he sat in his candle lit chambers. “I can’t be myself around you, Arthur.” Merlin said with his back still to him. All the doubts and second thoughts that have crowded his mind for years, were now slowly fading into something clearer; something he has been figuring out on his own while trying to maintain a constant neutral behaviour around Merlin. “Why?” his voice came out low and hoarse, as if he already didn’t have a guess in his mind to why Merlin couldn’t be himself around him. He slowly turned back to face him, and it felt like an ice bucket had just been poured all over him. Merlin’s eyes were glowing bright gold. They glared down at him, piercing right through his soul. Suddenly, Arthur forgot about the burning pain in his shoulder as if it were of no existence. He was glued to where he was sitting, unable to move from how unreal the situation was. No matter how many times he tried to visualise it in his mind’s eye, it never matched this. This was something else. This was Merlin confirming his nearly three years old thoughts. This was Merlin breaking the last barrier that kept him from being himself around Arthur. It wasn’t until the gold colour faded away and Merlin’s familiar blue eyes returned along with the thousands of unspoken words they held in them. Arthur was sure his own eyes were showing unexplained feelings, but he stayed silent, waiting for his manservant to speak his mind. “I was born with magic.” Merlin calmly stated, no longer sounding hesitant or sad. “But I’ve never used it except for you, Arthur.” he ever so softly continued, sending Arthur’s heartbeats into a frenzy. Out of all the things he could have asked, only one question kept ringing in his mind before he forced the words out. “Why now?” “I couldn’t hide it from you anymore. Not after—” Merlin gulped. “Not after what you said.” But that’s the thing. It wasn’t something that Arthur had said. It was what he felt. The love he had for the young man standing in front of him did not form overnight. It was countless sleepless nights and days of zoning out until every piece fell into its right place in his puzzle of a mind. Merlin has magic. No, he was born with it. Arthur assumed that this was already something greater than being able to practise magic by learning different incantations. This love grew every day with everything he realised that Merlin had done for him since the day he was hired as his manservant. Figuring it out wasn’t difficult for Arthur. Merlin was terrible at hiding his feelings when it came to him. He saw it in every ‘nothing’ that came after a ‘what’s wrong’. He saw it in the inexplicable triumphs he ‘achieved’. He tried to trip Merlin into spilling the words he had just heard, but it never worked. He stopped trying when he realised that maybe Merlin didn’t want to tell him. Maybe he wasn’t ready yet. Or maybe he didn’t trust him enough? He created thousands of reasons and tried to convince himself that they were true. But now, everything he has been building up has collapsed right at his feet, leaving his mind and heart unguarded. He didn’t feel threatened or scared, knowing that he was standing with one of the strongest sorcerers, in his chambers. Arthur’s chambers were the only place he could be unarmed in without worry. The one place Merlin could stay at for as long as he wanted; where Arthur freed himself of all the princely manners and the stone facade he had to put on whenever he was in the presence of his father and the court members. The place where he was just Arthur. He took the horror in Merlin’s facial expression as an indication that he needed to speak as well. Arthur was well aware of how composed he seemed to Merlin right now, because no one would have thought that he, the Future King of Camelot, would not lash out on his manservant for belonging to a group of people that he was raised to hate. “Can I ask you a question?” Merlin nodded a small nod, his eyes still holding a skeptical look to them. “Do you really think I’m just an arrogant pompous dollophead who can’t see past himself?” The question came out light, neither sarcastic nor showing the hint of hurt in Arthur’s voice with the possibility of Merlin not wanting to share this secret with him earlier. “What? No. No, Ar--” Merlin stopped talking, realising the real meaning behind Arthur’s question and his lips parted in shock. “You knew?” he breathed. Arthur only blinked and nodded, answering his question. “Why, why didn’t you say anything?” his voice came out small, and he had to clear his throat afterwards, trying to cover it. “I didn’t want to push you.” Arthur tenderly said. “Though I admit, I did try a few times.” he smiled, hoping it would bring Merlin a bit of comfort that it was fine. It was okay. He didn’t need to hide it anymore. He didn’t need to be afraid around him anymore. “I wanted to tell you.” Merlin confessed. Arthur didn’t dare ask why, because the list of reasons would never end. He couldn’t even ignore the spark of fear that settled in the pit of his stomach at the thought of someone hearing them. “But every time I thought about it, every scenario that went through my head ended in the same way.” he murmured, his shoulders slightly slumping. “That is?” Arthur asked, not knowing if he wanted to know the answer. “Losing you.” Merlin whispered. “I can’t lose you, Arthur.” He sincerely said, breaking Arthur’s heart. Heavy silence filled the air between them. The idea of not having Merlin in his life drove him mental. The possibility of his father finding out about this left his mind in ruins, and he couldn&#x27;t bear the thought of what it might bring. Merlin had a right to be afraid, but not from losing Arthur. He would never. Arthur gathered his strength and stood up with a low grunt, ignoring the pain that shot up his arm and reached the throbbing area where his chest met his shoulder. “What are you doing?” Merlin rushed towards him, but stopped when he found that Arthur had successfully got to his feet. “You lost me the moment you thought I would leave you for who you are.” he said, taking a step closer to him. Merlin didn’t move, but another tear fell from his right eye and Arthur was quick to wipe it away before it slid down his cheek. “You’re not mad?” he wondered out loud. Arthur shook his head, “Unwise of you to think that you could get rid of me that easy, Merlin.” the sentence drew a smile on his companion’s lips. Not after all the times he had saved his life in and the times he had to watch his own kind being hated and ruthlessly killed just for being themselves. They were standing inches away from each other and Arthur could feel his heart erratically beating in his chest, ready to jump out of his ribcage any second. Merlin stepped closer and took Arthur’s hands in his. His hands slightly stiffened at first but then he relaxed when Merlin’s thumbs softly caressed his knuckles, letting him know he sensed his unintentional discomfort. Arthur wasn’t used to any of this. The closest he has ever got to touch Merlin was through the occasional arm shakes they shared from time to time. Sometimes Arthur liked to tease him and ruffle his hair or pat his back, but that was all. Having Merlin hold his hands was something he thought he would never get to feel, even if he was the one who initiated the gesture when he wiped the young sorcerer’s tears. It brought a warm feeling to his being. A sense of familiarity that left him feeling like his hands were made to hold his. “I’m sorry I kept it away from you this long.” Merlin said. Arthur inhaled to reply but Merlin continued, unawarely stopping him. “I wanted to be myself around you, too.” He smiled. “And it pained me to let you think I wasn’t hiding anything from you while in fact, I was hiding the one thing you addressed as the highest form of love, Arthur.” he spoke, looking directly into Arthur’s eyes. His inner self was dancing in victory at Merlin’s words. He wanted to tell him, he wanted to share this part of his life with him, and Arthur was planning to hold onto this for as long as he could. Moments of silence passed and Arthur found himself speechless. His mind and heart were in an endless debate as he and Merlin stood too close from each other. Arthur knew that there was only one response to what Merlin said, and it didn’t involve talking. Would he do it? He answered his own thoughts by leaning in and closing the distance between them as his lips softly brushed Merlin’s. Merlin froze for a millisecond before he complied, his delicate lips connecting with Arthur’s. Arthur had pulled his hands out of Merlin’s only to grab them and rest them on his chest, careful to avoid his injury, while Arthur’s hands settled on the small of his back. The kiss ended all too soon, leaving both of them breathless. Arthur had a wide smile covering his face which faded as soon as Merlin opened his eyes. Arthur watched the gold colour die out in Merlin’s eyes just as he was opening them. His smile vanished, too, when he saw the expression on Arthur’s face. “What?” he asked, panic already starting to show in his eyes. “Arthur?” he asked again, but then his eyes fell on Arthur’s chest and his cheeks grew pink. Arthur followed his gaze and looked down at himself, letting a gasp leave his throat at the sight. His skin that was once cut open and bleeding was now as good as new. No signs of any previous wounds could be seen, and there was only one explanation for this. His eyes went back to Merlin’s face, which at any second, could explode from how red it was. “It’s uhm,” Arthur raised his eyebrows, waiting for him to form the words. “It’s my magic. It must have done that.” he pointed at where Arthur was wounded. “When we kissed.” Arthur smiled, “Does your magic always do things you’re not aware of?” “No.” Merlin shook his head with a smile that matched Arthur’s. “It does the things I desire the most, and sometimes I can’t control it.” “So, using your magic to heal me is one of your desires.” he concluded as Merlin drew patterns with his fingers on his chest. “My true one is never seeing you in pain.” he rested one hand on the side of his face, letting his thumb caress Arthur’s cheek. “I think I might be dreaming.” he claimed, his lips still holding a faint smile to them. “It is a beautiful dream, though.” Arthur replied, interlocking his fingers behind Merlin’s back where his hands rested. Arthur thought Merlin had zoned out while staring at him with something unreadable in his eyes, because he has been silent for a while now. “Merlin.” he called, catching his attention. “Yeah, sorry.” he focused back on him. “Is there something wrong?” Arthur asked, concerned. Merlin’s fingers fumbled together before he spoke. “There’s something I want to do.” “What kind of ‘something’?” Arthur narrowed his eyes, some of Merlin’s uncertainty transferring to him. “It’s-- it’s something nice, I promise.” he assured him. “Just- stand still, and please don’t panic?” Merlin shot him a sheepish smile. “Mer--” he was about to lecture him into not worrying him like that, but his tongue tied into a knot at what interrupted him. Merlin’s eyes glowed gold again. His eyes were fixed on Arthur’s head, where he felt something brushing at his hair. He was blown away by the sight as he stared at Merlin. His eyes looked beautiful, shining with strength and warmth at the same time. Just then, Arthur realised for sure, that he would never get used to seeing Merlin using his magic in front of him. He had known for a long time and yet he grasped that it would leave him feeling astonished every time. The gold colour vanished from Merlin’s eyes and a wide grin lit up his features. His eye crinkles were showing from how wide he was smiling at Arthur. Arthur raised his hand up to his head, wanting to know what Merlin did. His fingers were met with soft rose petals, bringing a smile tinted with confusion to his face. Merlin has enchanted a flower crown over Arthur’s head. “They’re purple gladioli.” Merlin smiled. “I read about them with Gaius before.” “Never heard about them.” Arthur&#x27;s eyes glanced up, trying to take a look, but only ending up seeing the very edge of the petals that rounded his head. “Why them?” “They reminded me of you.” his shoulders raised in a small shrug. “Roses reminded you of me .” Arthur said in disbelief, having a hard time processing that something as delicate as rose petals reminded Merlin of him. “In what way then?” he asked, fondness stirring inside him. “They stand for nobility, strength and grace.” Merlin answered, resting his hands on Arthur’s chest once again. “Everything that you are.” Arthur looked down, smiling, at a loss of words. He then proceeded to take off the rose crown and place it onto Merlin’s head instead. The colourful petals made his dark hair shine brighter. “It looks better on you.” He smiled. “Are you indirectly suggesting that I’d make a better looking prince than you?” Merlin teased. “Not exactly.” Arthur chuckled. “I’m saying that you would look good in a gold crown, too.” He said, sounding more serious. He watched as Merlin’s face grew perplexed, not catching onto what Arthur was hinting. “You can’t be serious.” Merlin shook his head. “I have never been more sure.” Arthur said, his tone filled with unexplainable reassurance. He had no idea how this occurred to him; the words just came flowing out with no preceding thoughts. The image of Merlin dressed in a full royal attire with a gold crown complimenting his features couldn’t leave Arthur’s head. Merlin looked like his eyes were about to pop out of their sockets. “What about Uther? Camelot? Have you suddenly forgotten that you’re their Once and Future King?” Merlin turned into a lecturing mother addressing her son. Arthur took a deep breath and let it out as a sigh, already having expected to hear this response from Merlin. He knew what he was doing. “The Once and Future King is asking you to spend the rest of your life with him, yet he hasn’t received an answer.” “Arthur--” “It’s not like we are getting married tomorrow, Merlin.” Arthur rolled his eyes. “I just,” He sighed, waiting for the right words to form in his mind. “I need to know if you’re willing to wait with me.” He briefly looked down before continuing. “Long enough until I’m king.” His eyes peered into Merlin’s. “And then we can freely live this dream beyond the doors of my chambers.” Merlin, as surprised as Arthur was by himself, stayed silent for a good amount of time, his eyes continuously flickering between Arthur’s. Arthur cocked an eyebrow at him, the silence growing too uncomfortable for his liking. “Yes.” Merlin breathed. “A million times yes.” He grinned, flinging his arms around Arthur. Arthur wrapped his arms back around him, his fingers running through his soft black hair. He didn’t care about anything else in the world. Right now, he wasn’t Prince Arthur, the Future King of Camelot. He was just a young man embracing the one he loved; unarmed, unguarded and free of all his formalities. “Now I have a valid reason for not keeping any armour in here.” Arthur said, his voice muffled by Merlin’s shoulder as they held onto each other. “I don’t need armour when I’ve got a sorcerer.” He retreated, eyeing Merlin with a grin. “One who would protect you with his life.” He smiled back, brushing Arthur’s hair out of his eyes. Their peaceful moment was interrupted by a loud booming sound that caused Merlin to jump. It came from outside, and Arthur found himself smiling at what the sound indicated. It was midnight, and the people of Camelot had just started celebrating the first day of a new year. He remembered the countless times he had skipped the boring feast his father held on New Year’s Eve to watch the celebrations that took place in the lower town from his chambers. The sound of music started playing, drawing an even wider smile on his face. “Come on.” Arthur tugged on Merlin’s hand, walking him towards the window and opening it. Cold wind came blowing at them and he shivered, but he was too content to tear his eyes away from the scene. Crowds of people of different ages filled the streets. Families, children and even elders danced to the music that was being played around them. Children held their parents’ hands and looked up at them with so much happiness in their eyes. Bakers shared their baked goods with everyone for free, spreading love and joy among those around them, especially the little children who sought the sugar filled treats. Bonfires were made for everyone to gather, laugh, chatter and even dance around them. Arthur’s eyes landed on a little boy who had a flower in his hand. He watched as he ran excitedly towards a woman whom Arthur assumed was his mother. He hid the rose behind his back and when he reached her, he stretched out his hand for her to take it. The woman covered her mouth in surprise and thanked her son, before she pulled him into a tight hug, laughing at the gesture. As much as the scene was warm and full of love, it brought tears to the prince’s eyes. His chest tightened at the unfamiliar feeling that slithered its way into his heart. Merlin must have seen what Arthur had been watching because he held his hand and squeezed it, catching his attention. Even though Arthur recalls nothing of her, having been told that his mother died giving birth to him, he still felt her absence from time to time. Every achievement he made, every year he grew older, every time he passed a new level of training, he wished he could share any of these things with her. How he would have loved for nothing but to be held in her arms after he’s returned from battle, or back at the time when he was younger, and his nightmares would force him out of his sleep. But none of that will ever happen. “I miss her.” Arthur whispered. “I know.” Merlin replied, his thumb wiping away the single tear that managed to fall out of Arthur’s eye. Merlin extended his arms out, and Arthur didn’t hesitate to let him hold him in that moment. He held onto him as tight as he could, before he took a deep breath and pulled away, letting his arms hang loosely around Merlin’s figure. “Look at me ruining the moment.” he half-heartedly joked. “We should be celebrating.” he smiled a small smile. “Don’t say that.” Merlin argued, sadness spiralling in his eyes. “This is the best celebration I have ever had.” he smiled. “Here with you.” “I’m glad you’re here, Merlin.” Arthur stared at the man in his arms, knowing that the pair of eyes that beamed back at him were a window to a new start, a better life, and he couldn’t wait to share it with him.

Notes Day 4 &quot;What are you hiding, Merlin?&quot; + Fun Arthur knew he had a superiority complex. The Prince bragged quite an amount, strutted through the citadel with the ado of a pompous brat and couldn&#x27;t help but belittle people every now and then. He was working on it though. Yet if there was one thing he could pride himself on, it was his sixth sense. Like a bloodhound he could smell when something was off . In his case, an ability like that wasn&#x27;t simply nice to have, it was vital. It helped him survive the sneakiest of bandit attacks and told him when one of his knights slacked off behind his back during the daily drill. Arthur was a master of intuition, nothing could escape his all-knowledgable nose. And the Prince would be damned if Merlin wasn&#x27;t hiding something. Arthur wasn&#x27;t able to put his finger on it. There had been some shifty energy about his servant lately. He didn&#x27;t prattle on as much, always seemed in a hurry to get away from him as soon as he had finished his chores and he flat out refused to comb Arthur&#x27;s hair - said he could do it himself. One time, the Prince followed him in the dead of night. Instead of answers, Arthur got even more questions - Merlin had gone to Elyan&#x27;s chambers, who let him in without any hesitation. It mustn&#x27;t have been the first time they had a rendevouz. Which made Arthur wonder wether his knight and manservant had an entanglement of sorts. Come to think of it, Merlin had been showing up with bags under his eyes regularly lately, not to mention the plenty complaints of sore muscles. What were they doing? Arthur did not like this one bit. It wasn&#x27;t like he didn&#x27;t trust Merlin. He had been a loyal, if clumsy, companion for several years. He had been witness to the Prince&#x27;s coronation, his many high&#x27;s and little low&#x27;s and would hopefully stand beside Arthur on the day he would be able to call himself King of Camelot. Arthur had all faith in him not to do anything too stupid. If he was to wait it out, Merlin would surely come to him himself. Only difficulty was: Arthur was as impatient as he was boastful. Obviously he waited half a day until he confronted the warlock. &quot;What are you hiding, Merlin?&quot; They were in the armoury. Training had went rather well, except for the fact Elyan ran up to Merlin to talk to him every time they took a break. It wasn&#x27;t uncommon for his servant to watch from the sidelines, he occupied himself with whatever - sharpening swords, mending tunics, polishing chainmails, you name it. Not so today. He had been scribbling frantically in a notebook, it almost looked like he was drawing. When Elyan had come up to him, Merlin immediatley showed him his creation. The knight had ruffled his hair affectionately. Arthur hated it. But then something even stranger happened: The prince had tried to get hold of the notebook and earned a slap on his fingers for it. &quot;Ow!&quot; &quot;Don&#x27;t... don&#x27;t touch that! It&#x27;s private!&quot; Well, apparently private to no one but Arthur, since Merlin proceeded to show Leon and Gwaine what he had made, too. It was infuriating, nonsensical and petty. And it was also hurtful. Arthur had thought they shared everything, from food to secrets to even clothing (Merlin washed their clothes together and falsely gave him one of his own tunics. If the Prince wore them anyway, it was no one else&#x27;s business). Heavens above, Arthur even knew about the warlock&#x27;s magic as the Crown Prince in a kingdom under the reign of Uther Pendragon. What was it that Merlin couldn&#x27;t tell him? &quot;Pardon?&quot; &quot;I said: What are you hiding, Merlin?&quot; His servants eyes widened, and had he been ridding Arthur of his armour in a slow-paced , comfortable manner then, now he scrambeled to finish up quickly. &quot;Sire?&quot; &quot;You have been behaving suspiciously lately.&quot; &quot;What are you on about?&quot; &quot;You don&#x27;t comb my hair anymore like you used to. You won&#x27;t even come eat dinner with me after you finish up work, I-&quot;, miss you , he had almost said. But Merlin was looking at him now so very strangely, he stopped himself. &quot;Doesn&#x27;t matter. What does, though, is that I&#x27;d like to know what my manservant is up to. Can&#x27;t have you ruining our reputation with illegal ongoings, now, can we?&quot; Merlin pulled off his leather gloves and tossed them onto the pile of armour next to them. &quot;Well, my lord , I have a right not to spend each waking hour with you, and I especially have the right to some secrecy. If you will excuse me, I have other matters to attend to.&quot; With that, he fled the chambers. -------------------- It was Yule, Merlin hadn&#x27;t spoken to him properly in a week, and Arthur felt like he would kill someone soon. He couldn&#x27;t even punish him for anything. The warlock was attending his duties with more care and weariness than usual, which made Arthur even more suspicious. Not only that, but he had seen scorch marks on Merlin&#x27;s forearms when he had poured hot water into the bath (not that Arthur watched him doing that). Upon asking about it, his servant just waved it off as nothing and pulled his sleeves down again. Arthur would never admit it out loud, but he was worried sick. Had Merlin gotten into some sort of trouble? Was someone hurting him? If so, they would soon face the wrath of Excalibur, Arthur only had to find out who they were. Just when he started plotting how he would torture the mystery person, there was a hesitant knock on his door. Who could it be at an hour this late? &quot;Enter.&quot; Arthur was surprised to see Merlin&#x27;s head peeping in. He looked rather sheepish. &quot;Sorry to interrupt. May I have a word with you, Arthur?&quot; The Prince&#x27;s chest swelled. It felt like ages ago that his friend had used his name to adress him instead of his title. He stood up quickly, pulling a chair to the table. &quot;Yes, of course Merlin. Have a seat.&quot; Merlin entered properly then, and upon closer inspection Arthur realized how horrible he looked. Dark circles had formed under his eyes, he looked more pale and thinner than usual and his shoulders were slumping under a weight invisible to Arthur&#x27;s eye. &quot;Thank you, but I would rather not sit.&quot; The Prince started chewing on his bottom lip. &quot;Oh.&quot; Merlin must have seen the disappointment on his face, because he quickly added: &quot;This is not to say I do not wish to talk to you. It&#x27;s just that I would like to show you something. It&#x27;s - it&#x27;s a surprise.&quot; Arthur&#x27;s brows furrowed. Was this about the secret thing? He pondered for a moment, then said, &quot;Fine. Where are we going?&quot; Merlin grinned playfully, and oh, how the Prince had missed his smile. &quot;You&#x27;ll see when we get there.&quot; ---------------------- Arthur knew what Merlin&#x27;s secret was: He was plotting to murder the Crown Prince of Camelot. Why else was he leading him into the forest in the middle of the night, seemingly searching for something off the usual trails? Arthur had a great sense of navigation, but even he was lost. His servant had told him he knew where they were thanks to his magic. &quot;Shouldn&#x27;t you be able to find the destination a bit quicker, then?&quot; &quot;Shut up, Arthur.&quot; The Prince was seriously considering to knock Merlin out and return home without him, when they broke through a thick line of bushes. In front of them lay a meadow, open and vast and so very beautifully lit by moonlight. Merlin took his hand and led him to the middle of it. Time truly felt altered there. It was as if the waves of space and mortality flowed around that clearing, not daring to enter and break the peacefulness that was embedded deeply in the very core of things. There was neither wind nor sound, only the tiny droplets of dew twinkling beneath them. A calmness spread within Arthur, and when he looked into Merlin&#x27;s eyes, fully golden and alight, he realized this was the doing of his magic. He could feel it: All the compassion, creativity and love that was woven into the atmosphere. His companion had let his gift roam free, and this is what it had done. This was so fitting for Merlin, it almost hurt. Arthur looked up to the sky. The moon looked bigger, and the constellations of the stars were not theirs. They were wrong for the time of year - Merlin had shifted everything. &quot;Do you like it?&quot; Merlin&#x27;s voice trembled. Arthur looked down to him again, tears were forming in his eyes. He didn&#x27;t mind one bit. &quot;This is the very essence of you, Emrys. How could I not?&quot; The warlock gasped at the mention of his druid name. The Prince knew who he truly was, of course. Merlin had been embarrassed plenty upon telling him he was the most powerful sorcerer to ever roam the earth, and not only that - but born like this, too. Merlin grasped something in the inside of his jacket. When he pulled it out, Arthur&#x27;s eyes widened in utter surprise. The warlock was holding a circlet made of silver. It was fragile, almost looked like it would break even in Merlin&#x27;s delicate hands. Tiny dragons were imbedded on it, and the longer Arthur stared at it, the more he was convinced they were actually moving. It was everything a King could ask of a crown, and then some. &quot;Have you made this? Is this why you have been spending so much time with Elyan lately? Why you were so tired? And the-&quot; &quot;And the scorch marks, yes. I was a little clumsy in the forge.&quot; Arthur chuckled. &quot;Yes, I would believe that in an instant.&quot; Merlin smiled, then turned serious. &quot;I am Emrys, magic itself and Leader of the Druids. It is my destiny to assure you are worthy of uniting the land of Albion. In these past few months of you taking over the role as King of Camelot due to your father&#x27;s inability, you have more than earned my undying respect. And love.&quot; Arthur shuddered. &quot;Therefore, I wish to crown you.&quot; Merlin&#x27;s voice was steady and deep. It was almost as if he was speaking a different language, one that was as ancient as the Old Religion. Right in that moment, Arthur wished for nothing more than to be crowned by his protector, his warlock, his friend. He felt humbled to his soul. He decided to kneel in front of Emrys. When he smiled down at him, Arthur could see that Merlin was proud of him. And that he loved him with all his heart. The Prince saw everything he ever wanted to see in those beautiful golden eyes. &quot;I, Emrys, last Dragonlord, Leader of the Druids and born by a human mother, crown you, Arthur Pendragon, Prince of Camelot and born of magic, the Once and Future King.&quot; With that, he lowered the circlet onto Arthur&#x27;s head. It nestled in perfectly. The dramatic air that had surrounded them broke with Arthur sobbing. Merlin fell down to his knees, hugging Arthur, whispering sweet nothings into his ear but he was too shocked and honoured to calm down. And he needed to tell Merlin something. &quot;I can&#x27;t express how much this means to me. I know I can be condescending and stupid but I truly appreciate you. Everything you have done for me, for the people of Albion - no words will ever be enough to show you my gratitude. The same instant I will be crowned King of Camelot, you will be made Court Sorcerer. I will have you only by my side and nowhere else.&quot; The warlock pushed him away a little bit, and Arthur thought he had said too much, but then Merlin&#x27;s lips crashed into his, and really, how was a man to think that way? Their kisses were open-mouthed, wet and salty of tears still running. Desperation of several years was being released, of two souls finally combining the way they were meant to. When they had lost all breath, Arthur touched Merlin&#x27;s forehead with his. &quot;I am glad you like your Yule present&quot;, Merlin whispered. Arthur could get lost in the gold of his eyes. &quot;How about as a present for you, I promise to crown you King Consort?&quot; Merlin leaped onto Arthur and toppled both of them over, giggling happily. They were all to be heard in that meadow, loud, joyful and alive, and more did not matter in that moment. As long as both of them lived and breathed, they would be able to conquer anything. Emrys and The Once and Future King. A love legends are made of.</span> <a href="#" class="summary-toggle">[ + ]</a></div><div class="stats"><div class="stat-item"><strong>Rating:</strong> General Audiences</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Archive Warning:</strong> No Archive Warnings Apply</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Category:</strong> M/M</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Fandom:</strong> Merlin (TV)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Relationship:</strong> Merlin/Arthur Pendragon (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Character:</strong> Merlin (Merlin), Arthur Pendragon (Merlin), Leon (Merlin), Elyan (Merlin), Gwaine (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Additional Tags:</strong> Fun, Idiots in Love, Boys In Love, Love Confessions, Magic, Arthur Knows About Merlin&#x27;s Magic (Merlin), Hijinks &amp; Shenanigans, Yule, Christmas Presents, Tooth-Rotting Fluff</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Series:</strong> Part 4 of Merthur Week 2020</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Collections:</strong> Merthur Week 2020</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Published:</strong> 2020-12-24</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Words:</strong> 2138</div></div></div><div class="work-entry"><h2 class="title"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://download.archiveofourown.org/downloads/24993835/One%20of%20Those%20Days.pdf?updated_at=1593506946" target="_blank">One of Those Days</a></h2><div class="summary"><span class="summary-short">Nothing is going right and everything seems too much.

Notes See the end of the work for notes Merlin was having one of those days. Things were going wrong everywhere he turned and it seemed that everything was piling on top of him, it was suffocating. It had started in the morning. He had woken up with Arthur as usual but the good morning kiss wasn&#x27;t the bliss that it usually was. Arthur had grown a little stubble and Merlin couldn&#x27;t help but inwardly cringe at the sensation. Arthur left for work and Merlin went to the kitchen. He tried to make some breakfast but everything was too loud. He switched off the kettle as it started to boil, and he steered clear of anything with crinkly wrapping. He ended up skipping breakfast. He couldn&#x27;t even think about the feeling of brushing his teeth. He felt disgusting. It got worse when he got a phone call. He tried his best to remember what he was being told, but the more he focused on that, the less he heard. His frustration was building and he was starting to feel panicky. He wanted to read a story but didn&#x27;t want to read. He wanted to watch something but he didn&#x27;t want to watch. He wanted Arthur but he wanted to be alone. It was one of those days. One of those days where everything is just a little louder, just a little more blinding, just a little bit too much. Merlin put on a baggy hoodie and some loose pyjama bottoms. He turned off the lights in their room and climbed on top of the bed with his light fluffy blanket. He shut his eyes but didn&#x27;t sleep. When Arthur came home and called his name there was no answer. Arthur frowned and went into their room. He spotted Merlin under the thin blanket and noticed that he wasn&#x27;t sleeping, though the lights were off. He understood that Merlin had days like this. Sometimes Merlin wanted to be left alone, sometimes he needed Arthur there with him. Arthur reached over and put his hand on the bed next to Merlin. &quot;Hey,&quot; he whispered. &quot;Please don&#x27;t touch me,&quot; Merlin said softly, but not unkindly &quot;Do you need anything?&quot; Arthur asked, equally as soft Merlin was filled with a sudden ache in his chest. He didn&#x27;t know what he did to deserve Arthur. All of a sudden everything from the day was too much. Merlin sniffled into his pillow and a few tears ran down his nose as his helplessness crashed over him. Sometimes he wished he was just normal. Maybe then he wouldn&#x27;t be as clumsy or forgetful. He would understand things instantly or be able to just get instructions. He remembered when Arthur brought him to a work party. He hadn&#x27;t been able to keep up with the conversations and there were so many things happening at once. They had ended up having to go home early. Merlin had felt so ashamed that he couldn&#x27;t have been better for Arthur. When he mentioned that Arthur should probably get someone better, he didn&#x27;t understand why Arthur got angry. Arthur had explained after, when everything had settled down, that it wasn&#x27;t Merlin that he was angry at. Merlin was still a bit confused about that but Arthur just told him that he loved him and that he didn&#x27;t want Merlin any other way. &quot;I don&#x27;t want someone else Merlin,&quot; he had whispered into Merlin&#x27;s hair. &quot;I don&#x27;t want you to change. I want you to always be you&quot; &quot;Do you want me to stay?&quot; Arthur asked, bringing Merlin back to the present. &quot;Don&#x27;t go,&quot; Merlin&#x27;s voice was almost inaudible. Arthur sat on the side of the bed and kept his hand where it was, beside Merlin. After a while, Merlin calmed. His hand snaked out from beneath his blanket and he rested it on top of Arthur&#x27;s. Arthur turned his palm upward and Merlin laced their fingers together. &quot;Have you eaten?&quot; Arthur asked quietly, breaking the silence. Even though the words were quiet, he didn&#x27;t miss Merlin&#x27;s almost imperceivable flinch at the noise. Arthur&#x27;s heart clenched. Merlin shook his head minutely. &quot;I&#x27;ll go make you some potatoes, yeah?&quot; Arthur said, making to get up. Merlin&#x27;s hand tightened its hold. &quot;You&#x27;ve got to eat something, love,&quot; Arthur said, with a worried little frown. Merlin sighed and let go of his hand. Arthur placed a gentle kiss on Merlin&#x27;s hair and got up. He knew it wasn&#x27;t likely that Merlin would finish the meal. He just hoped that he could get him to drink something and that tomorrow would be better. It was just one of those days. End Notes This was written mostly from personal experience.

I&#x27;d like to thank my wonderful beta kaseyboy for once again helping me. You&#x27;re the greatest. Comments are greatly appreciated. --- --- Arthur met Merlin for the first time thanks to Morgana and Leon. They were throwing a cookout for all the guys at the fire station. Leon was the fire chief of firehouse twenty-four and had a great bunch of firemen working for him. They were like one big extended family, so every June, they&#x27;d have a cookout at Morgana&#x27;s father, Uther Pendragon&#x27;s mansion. All the firemen and their spouses or significant others and children were invited. Merlin was the newest member of the &quot;family&quot; having only been with the department about seven months so this was the first cookout he&#x27;d been to. He was both a fireman and a trained paramedic so he was partnered with Gwaine, the only other paramedic on their shift, for all runs requiring an ambulance. The rest of the time, they were just part of the group. -------- Morgana knew Merlin was perfect for Arthur but didn&#x27;t know how to set them up since her brother always claimed he was too busy for a relationship. She knew, in reality, that he was just afraid to get involved with anyone because of Mordred. Mordred was the product of a drunken one-off Arthur had at uni with a girl named Sophia. She dumped the baby on Arthur&#x27;s doorstep as soon as he was born and diagnosed as being deaf. Arthur hadn&#x27;t even been aware that he&#x27;d gotten her pregnant. Uther had, of course, ordered a DNA test to prove Arthur was indeed the father before he welcomed the baby into the family. Uther had also instructed Arthur that he should get Sophia to sign over her parental rights which she more than happily did. Arthur didn&#x27;t really date because he didn&#x27;t want to get involved with someone and then have Mordred get attached only for the relationship to not work out and Mordred to feel abandoned. -------- Merlin was sitting at one of the tables set up around the swimming pool when Arthur walked out with Mordred. As soon as Arthur saw him, he stopped dead in his tracks and just stared. Mordred pulled on his hand a few times before he was finally able to get Arthur&#x27;s attention. &quot;Can I go play with the other kids?&quot; he signed. &quot;Sure, just be careful,&quot; Arthur signed back. &quot;I will Dad,&quot; he signed as he ran off. As soon as Morgana saw her brother, she walked over to him. &quot;Arthur, I&#x27;m so glad you decided to come after all,&quot; she said to him as she pulled him in for a hug. He had tried to get out of coming but Mordred really liked swimming so he reluctantly agreed. &quot;Yeah, me too,&quot; he told her as his eyes drifted back over to the handsome dark haired bloke. &quot;Who is that?&quot; he asked her as he tried to nonchalantly nod in the guy&#x27;s direction. &quot;Oh, that&#x27;s Merlin. He&#x27;s the guy I&#x27;ve been wanting to set you up with. He&#x27;s the sweetest guy you&#x27;ll ever meet. Come on, let me introduce you,&quot; she said as she grabbed his arm and started pulling him toward Merlin. &quot;Merlin, I&#x27;d like to introduce you to my brother Arthur,&quot; Morgana said as she shoved Arthur towards the table. &quot;Hi, it&#x27;s nice to finally meet you. I&#x27;ve heard a lot about you,&quot; Merlin said as he smiled and held out his hand to Arthur. When Arthur took his hand, it felt like magic surged through his body. He finally was able to say, &quot;it&#x27;s nice to meet you too. So you&#x27;re a fireman then?&quot; &quot;Yeah, well a fireman and I&#x27;m also a trained paramedic.&quot; &quot;That&#x27;s really great.&quot; Before he had a chance to say anymore, Morgana told the two that she needed to go check on something and quickly made her exit. &quot;Sorry, I think she&#x27;s trying to set us up,&quot; Arthur said to Merlin apologetically. &quot;Oh, don&#x27;t be. She&#x27;s been going on about you for months so it&#x27;s nice to finally be able to put a face to the man she described.&quot; &quot;She thinks I need to be dating and looking for my, and I&#x27;m quoting Morgana here, &quot;my one true love, my soulmate.&quot; She&#x27;s such a romantic,&quot; and he laughed as he said it. Merlin grinned as he asked him, &quot;don&#x27;t you believe that there is one true love out there for everyone?&quot; &quot;Don&#x27;t tell me you&#x27;re a romantic too,&quot; he teased. Merlin smiled as he shrugged his shoulders. &quot;I guess that explains why I&#x27;m still single. I guess I haven&#x27;t found my true love yet.&quot; Arthur blushed at that. The more he was around Merlin, the more he was starting to believe in soulmates and true love. Merlin met Mordred when he came over to ask his dad if he could get in the pool. &quot;Yes, but no messing around. You know the rules,&quot; Arthur looked at him sternly as he signed. &quot;I know Dad,&quot; he signed before he turned to Merlin. &quot;Are you a fireman like Uncle Leon?&quot; Before Arthur had a chance to tell Merlin what Mordred had asked him, Merlin signed back to Mordred, &quot;I sure am.&quot; Arthur was shocked that Merlin knew sign language. Mordred&#x27;s eyes lit up, &quot;cool.&quot; &quot;Yeah, it is cool Mordred. This is Merlin and he works with Uncle Leon. Merlin this is my son Mordred,&quot; Arthur signed. &quot;It&#x27;s very nice to meet you Mordred,&quot; Merlin signed before he bent over and held out his hand to Mordred. Mordred, being the little gentleman that Arthur raised him to be, took Merlin&#x27;s hand and once he&#x27;d released it, he signed his reply, &quot;it&#x27;s nice to meet you too Merlin.&quot; After that he rushed to get his shirt and shoes off so he could jump into the pool since he came wearing his swim trunks. Arthur and Merlin both kept a close eye on Mordred as they continued talking. Arthur asked Merlin how he knew sign. &quot;My best friend from childhood was deaf so I learned it for him,&quot; Merlin explained. Arthur was even more impressed with Merlin, if that was even possible. Arthur enjoyed Merlin&#x27;s company so much that he asked him out to dinner which Merlin more than happily accepted. They exchanged numbers before Merlin left. &quot;I knew you&#x27;d adore him,&quot; Morgana screeched as she ran over to Arthur as soon as Merlin was out of sight. &quot;Whatever you say Morgs.&quot; &quot;Oh, come on now Arthur. Are you going to try to deny that you&#x27;ve fallen for him already?&quot; He didn&#x27;t know how she was always able to read him so well. He thought she must be a sorceress. &quot;Well, I will admit that there is something about him...&quot; &quot;So when are you going on a date with him?&quot; she interrupted. &quot;Who says I am?&quot; &quot;Just stop it. I know you like him Arthur and it&#x27;s quite obvious that he feels the same. I&#x27;m really happy for you both,&quot; she said sincerely and with a smile. &quot;Wow Morgana, it&#x27;s not like we&#x27;re getting married.&quot; &quot;Not yet, but you will, in due time,&quot; she said as she gave him a knowing look. Arthur wondered if it was possible that she could be a seer along with being a sorceress. -------- Morgana hadn&#x27;t been wrong. Arthur and Merlin started dating soon after their first meeting. They were taking things slow because first, that&#x27;s how Merlin wanted it because he had these crazy ideas about romance and not rushing things and second, because Arthur didn&#x27;t want Mordred to get attached to Merlin until he was sure they had a future together. He&#x27;d never admit this to anyone, but he was absolutely positive they did have a future together because he knew Merlin was his soulmate shortly after meeting him. -------- The happy couple had been dating for more than nine months. Over those months, Arthur slowly started to include Mordred in more of their planned outings. Mordred really liked Merlin and Merlin adored Mordred. It was like they were already becoming a happy little family much to Arthur&#x27;s delight. -------- Mordred&#x27;s class went on a field trip to a nature preserve. There were caves throughout the preserve so the children were instructed to stay with their group and to not venture off the path. Unfortunately, Mordred didn&#x27;t heed those instructions. He went wondering over to a small cave entrance that went almost straight down underground. Before the teacher or chaperones were able to stop him, he&#x27;d fallen down into the cave and was out of sight. The police and fire department were called immediately. Leon&#x27;s crew was the first to arrive. By that time, all the other children had been put back on their bus so Merlin and Leon had no idea it was a deaf child trapped let alone that it was Mordred. When they arrived, the park ranger explained that the tunnel went back about four feet before it opened up into a large cavern probably 20 - 25 feet down meaning the child would have fallen that distance. Merlin immediately said he&#x27;d go down since he was the thinnest. Leon agreed since he was also a paramedic, and they feared what condition the child might be in. They&#x27;d been calling out repeatedly but never got any response back so they feared he may be unconscious or worse. Merlin got suited up in the harness that would lower him down into the cave once he made it through the tight space. He couldn&#x27;t wear any protective gear since it was too bulky. Just as Merlin was crawling into the opening, Arthur arrived and went running over. &quot;Where&#x27;s my son?! How is he?!&quot; he yelled to no one in particular. He was in such a panicked state that he didn&#x27;t even realize it was Leon&#x27;s crew that was on the scene until Leon came and put his arm around Arthur to try to calm him down. &quot;Leon, how is he?&quot; Arthur asked with tears in his eyes. &quot;Sorry Arthur, but we don&#x27;t know yet. We&#x27;re waiting on Merlin to reach him,&quot; Leon explained. &quot;What? What do you mean? Where&#x27;s Merlin?&quot; &quot;He just went down into the cave...&quot; but he didn&#x27;t get to say anymore because his radio suddenly came to life. -------- Meanwhile, once Merlin got through the initial cramped space, it opened up and Lance and Percy slowly lowered him to the cave floor. Once he was down, he turned on his flashlight and saw a small boy sitting on the floor with his knees pulled up to his chest with his head resting on them and crying. &quot;Hey, hey, it&#x27;s okay. You&#x27;re going to be fine now,&quot; he said trying to comfort the child as he kneeled down in front of him. The boy didn&#x27;t respond to him so he gently touched his shoulder to get his attention. He was shocked when he discovered it was Mordred down in the cave with him. Merlin put the flashlight down in such a way that it was shining on both of them. As soon as Mordred saw Merlin, he sat up and threw himself into his arms. Merlin held on to him tightly with one arm as he pulled out his radio. &quot;Leon, I&#x27;ve got him. It&#x27;s Mordred,&quot; he said into the radio. Before he said anymore, he put the radio down and gently tilted Mordred&#x27;s head so he could read Merlin&#x27;s hands. &quot;Do you hurt anywhere?&quot; Mordred shook his head no. &quot;Did you hit your head when you fell down here?&quot; Again, he shook his head no. Merlin quickly got back on his radio. &quot;He looks fine, doesn&#x27;t appear to have any broken bones, just a few cuts and bruises. Just give me a minute.&quot; Merlin then felt all around Mordred&#x27;s head to see if he could feel any bumps. He followed that up by shining the flashlight all over him to see if there were any injuries he didn&#x27;t initially see. &quot;He doesn&#x27;t appear to have a head injury either. I&#x27;ll have him in the harness in a minute so you can pull him up.&quot; &quot;Okay, just let us know when you&#x27;re ready,&quot; Leon told him. Arthur had never been more relieved in his life. Mordred was okay and Merlin was there to comfort him. He felt like the luckiest man in the world at that moment, all things considered. Suddenly, there was a loud noise and the ground shook. Then, all of a sudden, dust and dirt came pouring out of the tunnel opening. &quot;What the hell was that?!&quot; Lance yelled. The park ranger said all the movement around the cave and tunnel must have caused it to become unstable. Thankfully, Merlin had heard the start of the rumble so he had managed to push Mordred back against the wall and then stood in front of him to act as a shield to protect him. After the noise stopped, they both had trouble breathing because of all the dust and dirt in the air. Finally, it settled down so they could open their eyes. Merlin heard Leon on his radio. &quot;Merlin! Merlin! Are you and Mordred okay?&quot; &quot;Yeah, we&#x27;re both okay. Nothing hit us.&quot; &quot;That&#x27;s a relief. Just hang in there until we can formulate a plan to get you two out of there.&quot; -------- &quot;Daddy really loves you,&quot; Mordred signed as they were waiting to be rescued. &quot;That&#x27;s good cause I really love your Daddy and you too,&quot; Merlin signed back. They continued signing back and forth. &quot;I asked Daddy if we could keep you.&quot; This caused Merlin to chuckle. &quot;You did? What did your Daddy say?&quot; &quot;He said he was planning on keeping you forever.&quot; &quot;He did?&quot; &quot;Yes, he said he wants to marry you and then you&#x27;d be my Papa.&quot; Merlin was holding back his tears as he signed, &quot;I&#x27;d really like that.&quot; &quot;Me too, Papa,&quot; Mordred signed before he leaned his head against Merlin&#x27;s chest and fell asleep. Merlin sat there smiling, even though he was currently stuck in a cave, knowing that Arthur wanted to marry him. He knew he&#x27;d accept because he loved them both so much. -------- Finally, almost an hour later, Leon came over his radio. &quot;Okay, we&#x27;ve got it cleared enough to bring you two out of there. But Merlin, it&#x27;s still very unstable so you need to be careful.&quot; &quot;Okay, thanks Leon. I&#x27;ll have Mordred ready in a minute.&quot; Merlin woke Mordred up and got him in the harness and signed, &quot;this is very important. You have to hold onto the rope very tightly, okay. Don&#x27;t let go of it until the firemen have ahold of you, okay. Now, once they start pulling you up, don&#x27;t look down. Just keep looking up. It&#x27;s going to be a tight fit so you&#x27;ll probably have to help them get you out, okay.&quot; Mordred nodded his head at each of Merlin&#x27;s instructions before he gave Merlin a tight squeeze. &quot;I will.&quot; &quot;Go ahead, he&#x27;s ready,&quot; he radioed up. Percy and Lance were at the cave entrance and once he was up, they grasped onto Mordred and pulled him out. He gave them both a big smile before he saw his daddy and ran over into Arthur&#x27;s arms. When he finally pulled away, he signed, &quot;Daddy, Merlin saved me.&quot; &quot;I know baby, I know. He&#x27;s our hero.&quot; Mordred smiled and nodded his head yes before Gwaine came over to examine him. It was like Merlin said, no broken bones, just some minor cuts and bruises. How he had managed to fall that far without any serious injuries was a mystery. Morgana had arrived by this time. Arthur asked her if she could take him home because he didn&#x27;t want to leave until Merlin was out. &quot;Of course I will. Give the hero a kiss from me okay,&quot; she said. &quot;Will do. Thanks Morgana. I&#x27;ll be there as soon as I can,&quot; he said as he was hugging Mordred tight. &quot;It&#x27;s no problem. We&#x27;ll see you later,&quot; she grinned before she walked away with Mordred. They had already sent the harness back down and were pulling Merlin up when, all of a sudden, there was another loud noise before the ground once again shook, only this time more violently, followed by the same dust and dirt as before. &quot;Shit!...What the fuck!...No!...Merlin!&quot; Everyone seemed to be yelling at the same time. &quot;There&#x27;s been another cave in! We need additional trucks and heavy equipment now!&quot; Leon yelled into his radio as he ran over to where Percy and Lance were kneeling shining flashlights down into the cave to see if they could see Merlin. All the rock around the tunnel had collapsed leaving a much larger opening now. &quot;Merlin! Merlin! Can you hear us!&quot; they were both yelling as Leon was calling out to Merlin over the radio. &quot;The cave-in snapped the rope. I don&#x27;t know how high up he was when he fell,&quot; Lance said, fighting to keep his voice steady. &quot;Can you see him?&quot; Leon asked. Lance told him, &quot;not yet. There&#x27;s too much dust still in the air to see anything.&quot; &quot;Merlin, this is Gwaine! Hang in there, we&#x27;ll get you out soon! We&#x27;ve got more trucks and equipment coming! Just hang in there, okay!&quot; There was no response. Arthur just stood there looking on in horror for several minutes trying to get his mind around what had just happened. Then he cried, &quot;no...no...no...Merlin,&quot; as he collapsed to the ground. He couldn&#x27;t believe this. Merlin was supposed to be out of that damn cave and standing here with him while he thanked him properly. While they were waiting for the heavy equipment to arrive, Leon went over to Arthur. &quot;Hey, Arthur, it&#x27;s going to be okay. Merlin&#x27;s a fighter. We&#x27;ll get him out.&quot; Arthur heard Leon and all he could say was, &quot;when? When are you going to get him out of there? You need to get him out of there now Leon. I can&#x27;t lose him, I just can&#x27;t,&quot; and he broke down crying. &quot;I know Arthur. The equipment should be here any minute...&quot; Leon was saying as they turned to see the other trucks arrive. &quot;Sorry Arthur, I&#x27;ve got to go,&quot; and he ran over to the others to talk strategy. Less than twenty minutes later, a dozer was slowing removing the soil and rocks around the cave opening. It was slow work because they had to be careful to avoid causing yet another cave-in. It was the longest three hours of Arthur&#x27;s life waiting until they were ready to send guys down to get Merlin. Gwaine and Lance were all harnessed up and ready to go as soon as the dozer moved out of the way. &quot;Okay, lower him slowly!&quot; Leon yelled to his guys as Gwaine disappeared down into the now much larger opening. He was quickly followed by Lance. Everyone up top was on pins and needles waiting for either of the two men to come on the radio saying they had Merlin. It felt like hours but was only actually five minutes before Lance was heard. &quot;We&#x27;ve got him. It doesn&#x27;t look good.&quot; He was fighting back tears as he continued. &quot;He appears to have suffered head trauma. We need a backboard and neck brace.&quot; &quot;We&#x27;ll send them right down,&quot; Leon told him. When he looked over to his guys, Percy and Elyan were already in the process of lowering the items. Gwaine got on the radio to relay Merlin&#x27;s vital signs so they could get things ready for him when he came up and for the hospital to be prepared for his arrival. It took what felt like forever before Merlin was slowly pulled up. When he finally emerged, he was strapped securely onto a backboard, covered in dirt and unconscious. The dirt didn&#x27;t do a very good job of hiding all the blood though. From there it was a blur. Everyone was rushing around and as soon as they got an I.V. line started and got him stabilized and on the stretcher, they loaded him into the back of the ambulance and took off with their lights flashing and sirens blaring. Arthur wanted to run over to Merlin the second he saw him but knew he&#x27;d only be in the way so he stayed back so the other paramedics could do their job. He was still standing in the same place when Leon rushed over to him. &quot;You coming Arthur?&quot; &quot;What? Oh yeah.&quot; He was still in shock but somehow managed to get to his car and follow the ambulance to the hospital. He ran in and was soon joined by Leon and his crew. There was no update on Merlin&#x27;s condition. Gwaine and Lance, who were both covered in dirt, came over to stand by Arthur. &quot;Sorry Arthur. If I&#x27;d known this could happen I would&#x27;ve gone down there instead of letting Merlin,&quot; Gwaine told him. &quot;Gwaine, you know Merlin wouldn&#x27;t have let you,&quot; Lance said to Gwaine before he turned to Arthur. &quot;He&#x27;s a fighter. He&#x27;s going to be okay.&quot; Arthur nodded his head, &quot;yeah, he has to be.&quot; It was probably two hours later before the doctor came out. Dr. Gaius told them, &quot;Merlin has suffered some head trauma but after looking at the initial brain scans, I don&#x27;t expect there to be any permanent damage. He also has a dislocated shoulder, broken arm and fingers, three cracked ribs and numerous cuts and bruises. He should wake sometime within the next few hours.&quot; They all let out a collective sigh of relief and hugged each other. Arthur went and sat down in a corner by himself. He was overwhelmed with emotions. Now that he knew Merlin was going to be okay, everything that had happened today was finally sinking in. He could very easily have lost Mordred today. He was so fortunate that his son didn&#x27;t get hurt but just the possibility scared him to death. Then there was Merlin. He didn&#x27;t know what he&#x27;d do without him in his life even after such a short time. Merlin risked his life to save his son and that&#x27;s something he could never repay him for. He didn&#x27;t know what he ever did to deserve Merlin and his love but he did know that he would cherish it always. Leon came over to talk to Arthur. &quot;You can go home to Mordred. We&#x27;ll keep you updated.&quot; &quot;No Leon, I&#x27;m not going to leave him.&quot; &quot;I figured that&#x27;s what you&#x27;d say,&quot; he said with a grin. &quot;I really don&#x27;t know which of you is worse. It&#x27;s almost sickening how in love you both are,&quot; he chuckled. Arthur just looked at him and let a smile spread across his face thinking about Merlin being in love with him. -------- Arthur was sitting on the side of Merlin&#x27;s bed, holding his good hand and gently rubbing his cheek when he started to stir. &quot;Hey you, wake up,&quot; Arthur quietly said to him. Finally, Merlin opened his eyes. He looked confused like he was trying to figure out where he was. He smiled when he saw Arthur. &quot;What happened? Where am I?&quot; &quot;There was a cave in...&quot; Arthur began. Merlin quickly interrupted him almost frantic, &quot;how&#x27;s Mordred? Is he okay?&quot; &quot;Shhh...Mordred&#x27;s fine, thanks to you.&quot; Merlin breathed an audible sigh of relief upon hearing that before Arthur continued. &quot;You saved him. You&#x27;re our hero.&quot; He bent down and gave Merlin a sweet kiss since his lip was split. Arthur pulled back and just looked at his boyfriend in awe. He was so beautiful, even bloodied and bruised and with stitches over his temple. &quot;I love you so much Merlin. The thought of losing you...&quot; he stopped and had to put his head down while the tears flowed down his cheeks. &quot;Hey, it&#x27;s okay, I&#x27;m still here,&quot; Merlin told him as he put his good hand under Arthur&#x27;s chin so he was looking at him. &quot;I&#x27;m not going anywhere. I love you and Mordred too much.&quot; Hearing Merlin say that about, not only him, but his son too, made Arthur love him even more, if that was possible. Arthur got down on one knee. &quot;Merlin, I love you so much. You are my soulmate, my one true love. Will you make me the happiest man alive and marry me?&quot; A smile instantly spread across Merlin&#x27;s face as he nodded his head and said, &quot;yes, of course I will. I love you too.&quot; Before he knew it, Arthur was on his feet and had Merlin wrapped securely in his arms, being extra gentle as he kissed him tenderly. &quot;Merlin, I&#x27;m sorry. I know this wasn&#x27;t the most romantic place or way to propose, and believe me, I had something much more romantic in mind...&quot; &quot;It was perfect Arthur,&quot; Merlin interrupted as he pulled him back down for another kiss. -------- Merlin was released from the hospital, and into Arthur&#x27;s care, two days later. He was sore all over and he had to be careful how he moved because of his ribs. As soon as Arthur pulled up outside of his house, Mordred, who was inside with Morgana, rushed out to greet him. &quot;Are you okay?&quot; Mordred signed to Merlin when he saw his arm and hand in a cast and his still bruised face. Since Merlin only had use of one hand, Arthur had to sign for him. &quot;Merlin says he&#x27;s fine. Just a little sore but he&#x27;s so happy to see you.&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m happy to see you too. Daddy and me missed you.&quot; &quot;He missed you too,&quot; Arthur signed for Merlin to his son. Morgana came outside and gave Merlin a gentle kiss on the cheek and told him she was so glad he was okay. She then led Mordred back inside so Arthur could help Merlin in. As soon as they walked in, Merlin saw the big banner they had hanging on the wall. It said, &quot;Welcome Home.&quot; Merlin smiled but looked confused. &quot;Since we&#x27;re getting married anyway, Mordred and I want you to move in with us now, before the wedding. What do you say?&quot; Arthur spoke and signed. Merlin looked over at Mordred who was nodding his head as he signed, &quot;please say yes.&quot; He then looked back at Arthur who was copying his son by nodding his head as he too signed, &quot;please say yes.&quot; Merlin gave them both a blinding smile as he nodded his head yes. Both father and son hugged him, but not too tightly. Arthur could tell Merlin was getting tired so he led him back to his bedroom which was now their bedroom. Merlin wanted to shower before he climbed into bed so Arthur slowly helped him undress. As he saw the many cuts and bruises that covered Merlin&#x27;s body, he started getting misty eyed. Once he had him undressed, he wrapped his cast up to keep it dry before he turned on the water and helped Merlin into the shower before he stripped and got in with him where he proceeded to wash his hair and then his body before drying him off and getting him into bed. He was barely able to kiss him before Merlin fell asleep. -------- Three long months later, Merlin had finally been cleared by the doctor to return to work. Over those three months, Arthur and Mordred had taken such good care of him and the three of them had grown even closer. When Arthur drove him to the station for his first shift, the crew was thrilled to finally have him back. They had all seen Merlin on numerous occasions while he was recovering but there was just something about Merlin that made everyone smile and they&#x27;d missed that in his absence. The guys immediately surrounded him as Arthur moved out of the way. He knew what Merlin meant to them all. -------- A few months later, Arthur and Merlin walked down the aisle together to join Mordred, who was standing in front anxiously waiting on them. Soon they were pronounced husband and husband. They kissed each other lovingly before they both turned to Mordred. Arthur picked him up so they could give him a joined hug. A little more than a year later, well after Merlin had officially adopted Mordred, they adopted a little girl named Jenny. When Leon and Morgana&#x27;s annual cookout came around again, Arthur arrived late because of a work emergency. This time, when he walked out, it was to see Merlin, his true love, his soulmate, holding their daughter while watching their son swimming. When Merlin saw Arthur, he gave him the brightest smile and Arthur knew he was the luckiest man alive. The end.

He knew these shelves like the back of his hand. But he could never guess what else he could find among the books. Notes See the end of the work for notes Merlin has been working at the library for ages now. He’s had to check out awkward books, deal with awkward or angry people, not to mention all the things he’s seen while trying to reshelve books. No matter what he’s come across, nothing could have prepared him for that day. The day he met Arthur. The day started out just like any other. Merlin was late, as usual, and trips up the steps to the large oak doors of the library. He was sitting at the desk, checking books in from the previous evening when the doors opened again. He looked up to see the visitor. He was was tall, blond, and very handsome. Merlin didn’t recognize him, which wasn’t a surprise, it’s not like he knows everyone who lives in the town. The man approached the desk and Merlin could see his blue eyes clearly, and Merlin couldn’t help but blush when the man talked to him. “Do you have any books on American Economics?” the man asked. Merlin was a little lost in his eyes but he managed “Yeah, over in the reference section,” “Can you show me where that is?” he asked Merlin. “Sure I can,” replied Merlin, “And I’m taking…” “Arthur,” Arthur replied, this time he was blushing “My name is Arthur.” Merlin took Arthur over to the reference section, which was empty that day. It was a weekend, so most of the students were taking advantage of the nice weather to be outside, not cooped up in the library studying. Merlin glanced back at Arthur. He found Arthur looking back at him, but when Merlin met his eyes, he looked away blushing. Arthur was very attractive, and Merlin didn’t know what he was doing in the library on a Saturday. He was about to ask when they arrived at the economics section. Merlin tries to gesture to the section, but at the same time Arthur reaches out for a book. They end up in a tangled mess with Merlin accidentally pinning Arthur to the book shelves. They were so close and if Merlin moved a bit forward more - “ MERLIN !!!” Elena came out from behind the shelves. Merlin backed up hurriedly from Arthur. “WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? I’VE BEEN LOOKING ALL OVER FOR YOU AND… oh hello,” Elena stopped mid- rant, just having noticed Arthur “Have you found what you were looking for?” “Oh,” Arthur started, and then stared intently at Merlin “Yeah, yeah I think I have,” Merlin blushed, but Elena didn’t notice. “Ok then, I’ll check that out to you then,” she said to Arthur. To Merlin, she simply said “New books in the back, you know what to do.” With one final glance at Arthur, Merlin went to the back to catalog the new arrivals. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ A few days later, Merlin still hadn’t seen Arthur. He was checking books back in at the desk when a paper fell out of The New American Economy . Usually he just threw these things out, because it’s common that the last person left a bookmark or receipt in a book they read. But as he reached to pick it up, he saw his name on it. He unfolded the note and it read: You seem much more interesting than capitalism. Maybe see you around sometime? -A . Merlin pocketed the note with a small blush and tried his best to concentrate the rest of the day. He was doing well until he heard a familiar low voice. “I just loved my last book and experience here,” whispered Arthur, “I don’t suppose you’d have any books on the 2008 economic crash in America?” Merlin raised his eyes slowly and smiled. “If you’ll just follow me,” he said. He turned and led Arthur back to where they were before. Arthur found his book and started “So, Merlin. There’s something about you. I was wondering if you…” He was interrupted by Elena once more, but this time she had tripped over a spectacularly tall pile of books nearby. Merlin rush to help her, and by the time all the books were back in place, Arthur was gone. Sighing, Merlin returned to his desk. To his surprise, he found a note that said Until next time. Maybe that section is bad luck. - A. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Two days later, Merlin was running later than usual. His alarm didn’t go off and he missed the tube. He didn’t have time to eat breakfast or caffinate. On top of all that, he actually did fall up the stairs. He could have sworn someone helped him up and tried to make conversation, but he was in too much of a hurry. He nearly ran into the oak doors of the library before stepping in. Shit. He was twenty minutes late. He hurried to the desk before Elena could come by and chastise him for being late. As he was checking in books, a familiar note fell out of one of the books. He held his breath as he opened the note. For some odd reason, I adore your ears. Would you like to see a movie with me tonight at 8pm? It was going to be a silent movie, but those ears of yours need a job. - A. Merlin smiled and carefully folded the note and placed it in his pocket. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Merlin checked the time eagerly. It has been two years since his first date with Arthur, and everyday since, Arthur has insisted on coming and picking him up from work. Merlin said it was because he was an overprotective prat, but Arthur insisted it was because Merlin was a danger to himself and others when out in public. Sure enough, a few minutes after the end of his shift, Arthur walked through the door. Like always he leaned over the desk and kissed Merlin in greeting. “Hello, love,” Arthur whispered after they parted. “Hello yourself,” Merlin replied, “You’re all dressed up. Did you have a meeting or something?” “No,” replied Arthur “Can’t I just dress up for my boyfriend for taking him out for dinner?” Merlin snorted. “You never have before,” he replied “Why start now?” When Arthur didn’t reply, Merlin looked up from what he was doing. Arthur had a look of seriousness on his face, mixed with eagerness. “Arthur?” Merlin questioned. “Come with me,” Arthur said and dragged Merlin away. Merlin was going to scold Arthur for going too fast in the library, then he realized where they were. In the reference section. More specifically, the place where all the books about the American economy were kept. Merlin turned to Arthur to find him on one knee. “I had to do this here,” Arthur started, “I used to think it was our unlucky section because of the times that Elena interrupted us here. Both before we were dating and all those times after. But then I realized that the opposite was true. If it wasn’t for this section of books, I wouldn’t be able to call you mine,” Arthur took a deep breath and finished, “So to continue the tradition of our section, Merlin Emrys, will you do the honor of becoming my husband?” A huge grin broke across Merlin’s face. “Yes, yes of course I’ll marry you!” he said and Arthur slipped a ring on Merlin’s finger, and then an identical one on his own. Merlin pulled in Arthur for a kiss. It was just starting to promise something more when Elena came around the stack and cheered for the two of them.

I hope it&#x27;s okay. :) See the end of the work for more notes When Arthur realizes it, it hits him like a pound of bricks. It’s stupid honestly, how he realizes it. He’s sitting on his bed, listening to some cheesy mix tape that Merlin had made him a few months ago, but it brings back amazing memories. Merlin’s eyes were downcast and he was biting his lip as he tossed a CD case to Arthur one day while they sat together at lunch. “What’s this?” he asked, looking it over. It was a blank case and on it Merlin had simply drawn a heart in the far left corner with black Sharpie marker. Merlin muttered something under his breath and Arthur looked up in confusion. “Huh?” “I said it’s a mix tape.” His cheeks turn red as soon as he says it and he’s yet to look up and make eye contact with Arthur. Arthur on the other hand, is shocked. A mix tape? He wasn’t aware that people did that in real life. He could have sworn that shit was only for the movies and books yet, he feels absolutely delighted. He’s never been made a mix tape before, never mattered enough to anyone for that, and it makes his heart swell with happiness that Merlin does it for him. “Merlin,” he says softly as he tries to get his boyfriend’s attention. “I know, I know, it’s stupid and cheesy, but I just thought it would be nice, you know? It’s a bunch of songs that are my favorites and remind me of you, of us. I thought it’d be nice, you know, for when you’re away from me…” he trails off quietly and Arthur smiles softly at him. “I love it,” he says and he means it. “Thank you, Merlin. It’s the best gift anyone has ever given me.” And when Merlin looks up at him with wide eyes and a shy smile, Arthur knows that he meant every word. Crazy Beautiful by Ashley Parker Angel is playing from the speakers and Arthur finds himself smiling at the lyrics. He’d teased Merlin about it at first, about how it was technically about a girl, but Merlin told him to change the pronouns and it was basically written for Arthur. And it’s true. Before he had found Merlin, Arthur had been really fucked up and not just with his attitude. He’d felt pressured by his father to always get straight A’s and excel in his schoolwork while he also felt pressured to also be the best football captain Camelot High had ever seen. This all piled on top of him during his sophomore year of high school and he ended up turning to drugs to take his mind off things. He regrets it now, more than anything, especially because he knows that if he hadn’t met Merlin that day, then he probably wouldn’t even be alive. It was stupid really. Him and his best friend at the time, Valiant, had gotten into some hardcore stuff during the middle of their junior year and before he knew it, he was packing so much shit up his nose that he couldn’t even smell his favorite flowers outside in the garden. A party one night at their other teammates house, Gwaine, caused everything to blow up. Arthur had already done a few lines before picking up Valiant and once they’d reached Gwaine’s lake house, Arthur was so fucked up he would never fully remember what happened that night. From what he does remember though, and what Merlin’s told him, Valiant had tried to get Arthur to do a narcotic that he knows he would have never touched had he been sober. Merlin had found Arthur just as he was about to do it and upon seeing how Arthur was clearly already out of it, he jumped in and stopped the whole thing. Valiant had been pissed and tried to fight Merlin, but then Gwaine and Leon came in, and kicked him out. Arthur gets embarrassed and ashamed when he looks back on that day and realizes how he must have looked to everyone, but they never held it over his head. In fact, they all helped him out and he was thankful for that. He was mainly thankful for Merlin, though. He had stayed by his side through everything and Arthur feels an insane amount of gratitude for him. He considers himself lucky that Merlin fell for him even after seeing Arthur at his lowest. The thought alone makes Arthur’s heart stop and that’s when he realizes it. It’s half past three in the morning; they have class tomorrow, and Arthur is over here listening to love songs and getting hit with revelations, because holy fuck, he loves Merlin. He, Arthur Pendragon, loves Merlin Emrys and really, he’s probably loved him for a while now but of course he’d realize it right now when Merlin is across town and probably asleep. But why does it matter? He’s in love! Surely Merlin would want to know this good news. Arthur jumps up from his bed and gasps. “I should go tell him!” It seems like a perfectly rational idea and he hurries around his room to throw on a shirt and some shoes. He doesn’t even look to see what he’s grabbed because he knows that Merlin will love him either way. Well, Arthur hopes he loves him back, because that would kind of suck if he didn’t, but he supposes he could live. Maybe. Probably not. He grabs his keys and throws open his bedroom door and nearly yells as he’s met with the angry and sleepy face of his sister. “What the fuck are you doing?” She growls out. “It’s nearly four in the morning!” “I love Merlin!” He grins and Morgana just gives him an annoyed look. “Okay? I knew that, everyone knows that! So again I will ask: what the fuck are you doing?” “I have to tell him!” “Right now?” She looks at him as if he’s crazy, but he doesn’t care, he just nods quickly. “Yes! I have to go now! Bye!” He races past her, down the stairs, and rushes outside to his car. It’s freezing and he isn’t wearing a jacket and only has boxers on, but whatever. This is important. Merlin’s house is only a fifteen-minute drive from Arthur’s, but it feels like a lifetime before he finally pulls up to the white, Victorian styled home. He parks across the street so he won’t wake up Hunith and quietly closes the door as he runs to where he knows Merlin’s window is. As he glances up at his boyfriend’s room, he bites his lip and tries to think of how to get Merlin’s attention. It’s not like he can just walk inside of the house, but Merlin’s room is on the second floor so he’s not quite sure what to do. He walks forward to get closer and nearly trips over a rock. “That’s it!” He whispers in glee to himself. He’s seen enough cheesy movies to know that tossing rocks at windows to get someone’s attention is probably the most romantic thing you could ever do. “This will guarantee that he’ll fall in love with me.” He picks up a tiny stone and lines up his aim before throwing it softly at the window. It hits it and he waits. After a few minutes, he realizes that the pebble obviously wasn’t big enough so he picks up a slightly larger one and throws it with a little more force this time. Only “a little more” is actually a lot more and Arthur gasps and jumps back as the rock smashes through the window and glass falls down around him. His jaw is practically on the ground as he stares up at the window, debating whether he should run away or stay. Before he can decide though, Merlin comes up to the window, hair messed up beautifully and shirtless. He looks fucking gorgeous and Arthur’s mouth waters a bit at the sight. “What the hell!” The shout breaks him away from his thoughts and for the first time, he notices that Merlin looks pissed off. “What’s your problem, Pendragon?” He yells out and Arthur winces. Merlin only calls him by his last name when he’s really angry, but he doesn’t let it discourage him. He’s on a mission! “I love you!” Arthur whisper yells with a smile so big that his face is actually starting to hurt. “What?” Merlin deadpans, but he sounds more awake now so Arthur will count that as a win. “I’m confessing my love to you!” Merlin just stares down at him. “Did you hear me, Merlin?” He asks louder, but the smile is still on his face. “I am in love with you! Isn’t it the best thing you’ve heard all day?” “Go away.” Merlin whines. And excuse me? What? This is not how this goes. “Don’t you love me too?” Arthur asks, confused. “It’s four in the morning! Go to sleep, Arthur!” “But I love you!” “You can love me in the morning!” Arthur just scoffs and shakes his head. “How can I sleep when I’m in love?” “I’ve been doing it just fine, so I’m sure you’ll live.” Arthur is about to say something back (profess his love again), when the words hit him and he lets out a sound of glee and smiles widely once again. “You love me, too!” Merlin just laughs and shakes his head. “Go to sleep, you moron. Pick me up in the morning and we can go eat breakfast before school.” “Okay! I love you!” He feels as if he’ll never get tired of saying it. “I love you.” Merlin says back softly and Arthur knows he’ll never get tired of hearing it. He’s walking away when a thought hits him and he runs back. “Merlin?” Merlin comes back to the window and raises an eyebrow. “Yes?” “You look gorgeous, baby.” He winks and Merlin lets out a loud laugh before shaking his head. “Arthur?” “Yeah, baby?” Merlin gives him a sultry look and bites his lip and Arthur groans at the sight. “You owe me a new fucking window.” And then he walks away leaving Arthur stunned. “I’ll buy you a new fucking house! For the both of us!” He yells out once he gathers himself up. He hears Merlin laugh and with a smile and a content heart, Arthur walks back to his car, letting the sound of Merlin’s laughter be his soundtrack for the drive home. End Notes Was it okay? I was really thinking of starting a series where I could take prompts from people and just write cute little Merthur fics. :) If you would like to see me write more, or even have a prompt for me, (or you&#x27;d just like to talk) you can leave it in the comments or message me on my tumblr ! also this is the song Crazy Beautiful and I&#x27;d really recommend listening to it!

Don’t expect anything special Merlin and Arthur has been riding side by side all morning, desperate to find a cure for a magical illness. Merlin, being the court sorcerer of Camelot, was required to solve issues such as this. Arthur of course, insisted upon accompanying him for protection and because the illness was striking citizens of his kingdom. Leon was with them also, simply wanting to enjoy some fresh air away from the palace and see to it that Arthur’s life was not in danger. It wasn’t that Leon didn’t trust Merlin to take care of Arthur, but he knew Merlin might easily get distracted and in a second Arthur could be shot or stabbed. Just as assumed, no trip with Arthur and Merlin could end peacefully. Three large men, dressed in rags, slid out from their hiding places behind the trees. “Halt! Unload your saddles!” The bandit in front of the other two commanded. Arthur and Merlin shared amused glances with each other before remaining on the horses. Leon shuffled awkwardly in his seat, knowing the king and sorcerer had a plan. It was as if they had some telepathic communication. Unfortunately, Leon has no idea what they were thinking. “Oi! Are you lot deaf? I said dismount and empty your saddles!” “We heard you, sir. We simply don’t believe you pose a challenge!” Arthur responded. “Alright! We’ll see how much of a challenge I pose now!” Said bandit cried. He aimed his crossbow at Merlin, who yawned in boredom. Arthur, however, seemed rather upset with this circumstance. Arthur dove towards Merlin, pulling them both off their horses. Merlin hit the ground with an grunt. Arthur jumped in front of a disgruntled Merlin, covering his sorcerer’s body. Merlin tolled his eyes and shot Arthur an exasperated look. “Arthur, I am fully capable of handling myself.” He sighed, stepping in front of Arthur and lifting his chin stubbornly. Arthur gasped at Merlin in mock horror, lifting his hand to his chest to indicate he was offended. “I will have you know I’ve been trained to kill since birth! I don’t need your protection!” And then Merlin laughed. Merlin laughed so hard his knees buckled, and he collapsed to the ground in hysterics. He wiped the tears from his eyes but his grin remained plastered on his face. “You prat! I’ve saved your life ten times this week! It’s Tuesday!” Arthur growled and made to lunge for Merlin, before the bandit coughed under his breath. “Ahem. Gentlemen, we really must be going. If you’d be so kind as to-“ “Erase you from your sorry existence? With pleasure!” Merlin smirked, sending each man flying. Arthur rolled his eyes. “Just do you know, I was fully capable of...” The king was cut off at a twig broke behind them. They both turned their heads in sync, looking over to see that there was indeed, another bandit. “This one’s mine!” Arthur screamed. “Oh you’re on, Pendragon!” Leon face palmed, once again wondering why on earth he pledged his allegiance to the king of Camelot.</span> <a href="#" class="summary-toggle">[ + ]</a></div><div class="stats"><div class="stat-item"><strong>Rating:</strong> General Audiences</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Archive Warning:</strong> No Archive Warnings Apply</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Category:</strong> Gen</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Fandom:</strong> Merlin - Fandom</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Character:</strong> Merlin, Arthur Pendragon, Leon</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Additional Tags:</strong> bandits, Angst, Protective Arthur Pendragon (Merlin), Protective Merlin</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Published:</strong> 2019-12-23</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Words:</strong> 506</div></div></div><div class="work-entry"><h2 class="title"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://download.archiveofourown.org/downloads/47686372/Quirky%20Merlin%20Things.pdf?updated_at=1686027102" target="_blank">Quirky Merlin Things™</a></h2><div class="summary"><span class="summary-short">AU where it isn’t common knowledge that the eyes of magic users turn gold and Arthur just assumes it’s another Quirky Merlin Thing™.

Or, Merlin thinks Arthur knows, and acts like it. Arthur is fine with the whole thing. Notes See the end of the work for notes It only happens when Merlin’s dragging. Only when they’ve all been run ragged– pushed to their limits and then past. Only when he can scarcely move one foot in front of the other, can’t even look in the direction of Arthur’s laundry. The first few times Arthur doesn’t even register it. His brain just files it away because Gold eyes? That isn’t something that happens. But one night he’s falling over himself into bed after a gruelling fight against a magical woodland creature he doesn’t even want to know the name of that they’re all painfully lucky to have escaped. Merlin mercifully ignores his shaking hands and Arthur looks the other way when Merlin’s face is damp after the thing is finally killed. And if Merlin’s hands are more tender that night as they unfasten his armor, Arthur chalks it up to the surprise of someone ill-acquainted with death. It had been a long ride back and his eyes were heavy long before the turrets of Camelot came into view. Laying there, collapsed on the sheets, Arthur has no idea how Merlin is still standing. He looks bone tired as he tries to drag Arthur’s boots off. Merlin’s putting his entire weight into pulling the boot when his fingers slip and he falls backward, landing on the floor with a loud thump. The boy chokes back a sob. Arthur wakes when Merlin stands again. He wonders how long it has been. Merlin looks determined now, as he grabs the boot again, and his eyes flash gold . The boot comes off and Merlin has the rest of his armor off and is gone before Arthur can really process anything. He’s asleep before he knows it. The next morning, however, it’s unmistakable. Sometimes Merlin’s eyes turn gold. It was really a very nice shade. It ought to have been unsettling but it was warm and inviting more than anything. He had asked around but no one seemed to know of gold eyes or even eyes occasionally changing color. And so, he assumed it was a Quirky Merlin Thing™. The thing about Merlin was that he was the most delightfully random human Arthur had the pleasure of knowing. He had a spectacular knowledge of herbs and Arthur found it embarrassingly enchanting o listen to him ramble about the medicinal value of birch bark. It was a Quirky Merlin Thing™. He constantly found the most ridiculous things to wear. Arthur asked him about the neck scarf one day, and Merlin had just stared at him with confusion as if it were the most common fashion trend in Camelot. Arthur gently pointed out that he had never met a single other human that wore one. Merlin didn’t seem to get the point. It was a Quirky Merlin Thing™. Sometimes he disappeared in the middle of the day without permission or apology. Quirky Merlin Thing™. He brought Arthur daisies one time. Quirky Merlin Thing™. He carved ducks into spare bits of wood when he was distracted. Quirky Merlin Thing™. He could walk on his hands, shockingly well. Quirky Merlin Thing™. He only ever drank lavender tea, despite complaining ardently that it tasted exactly like soap and making faces while consuming it. Quirky Merlin Thing™. Once, Arthur thought he saw him talk to a drape. And so, his brain helpfully filed Merlin’s gold eyes in this category and he moved happily on with his life. Except, the eyes fascinated him. He found himself staring sometimes, desperate to catch a glimpse again, to find out what he was missing, to watch the transformation and slip back to their normal dusty blue. He tried to figure out what caused them. Tiredness, he knew. But also empathy. It happened sometimes on Arthur’s birthday or the anniversary of his mother’s death when he couldn’t quite push the ache in his chest from his memory. It killed Merlin, Arthur knew, so most of the time he gave Merlin the day off or resorted to hiding. Merlin always found him. And sometimes, the eyes would happen. Late nights of travel had Arthur keeping Merlin later than he should have, eyes trained on the boy’s face. Long days saw the prince running through chambers to find his servant and keep him awake. Tournaments usually hit Arthur so hard that he couldn’t keep awake, but sometimes, when Arthur was particularly hurt, the eyes would glint sparks. – It had been a leisurely day. Arthur had given the knights the day off to spend with their families, preparing for Easter celebrations the next day. Merlin, of course, didn’t have any family to spend the day with as Gaius was tending to Morgana, particularly sick from a recent bout of nightmares. Absolutely nothing was happening. Merlin was polishing armor in the chair by the fireplace. Arthur was eating an apple. He had nothing better to do. “I’m bored.” Merlin sighs and looks at him resignedly. “You could help me polish.” Arthur stops chewing and stares at him for a moment. “‘M not that bored.” Merlin sighs again and resumes the movements of his cloth. The sun through the window lights up the floor around Merlin’s feet, basking his face in a sort of afterglow. His face is bright and his slender fingers appear to be magic as they flash in and out along the greaves. His brow is furrowed in concentration and Arthur smiles. He likes this Merlin, focused wholeheartedly on the task at hand, not distracted by things so far in his head that Arthur can’t get to him. He seems peaceful. He’s long since finished his apple. He also doesn’t know how long he’s been staring. “Merlin.” He says it softly, gently, unwilling to break the peaceful atmosphere in the room. Merlin looks up and fixes Arthur with that gentle smile, reserved only for him. Arthur licks his lips. “Do you know,” he says slowly, and he doesn’t know what makes him say it. He just wants Merlin to know that Arthur admires him and respects him. He just wants Merlin to smile, wants the tips of his ears to turn red, wants this soft, perfect moment to go on being soft and perfect for a little while longer and then maybe a little bit more. “Do you know that your eyes are beautiful when they glow gold?” It has the exact opposite of the intended effect. Merlin starts, and he starts badly, dropping the armor with a clang, which scares even him. His eyes are wide, terrified and then he’s running. He’s out of the room before Arthur can even call to him. Arthur is left faintly wondering what he did wrong, nursing a slight case of disappointment at the spoiled afternoon. – Gaius is not back and Merlin isn’t sure if he is happy or horrified at this. Fuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuck. “Okay Merlin, Arthur knows. It’s just Arthur, right? Just Arthur, the crown prince. Just the crown prince of Camelot who is currently involved in a nation-wide witch hunt who knows that you happen to be a sorcerer. That’s all. Just Arthur.” He heaves a book at the nearest bookshelf, not at all gratified when the ancient thing splinters. He does feel bad and feels his magic putting the thing to rights. These are Gauis’ chambers after all. Merlin clenches and unclenches his hands on the wooden table, dragging deep breaths in and out. It had been the eyes that had given him away in Ealdor too. Magic hadn’t been gone for as long; it had taken Uther and his band of terrors almost a decade to reach every outlying village. Almost everyone remembered what the golden eyes were of magic. For his friends and neighbors, they were things of beauty and hope, but after Uther also things of pain and suffering. And Arthur knew. Arthur fucking knew. – He lays low for a few days. The next day is easy because it’s a holiday and the castle is busy and he pleads sick the second day. But by the third day he’s sick with worry and even more sick with waiting, so he leaves the rooms before dawn and makes his way to Arthur’s chambers. He lights the fire, and pulls Arthur’s clothes for the day, before pulling the curtains open. He swivels only to find a very awake Arthur. “You’re up.” “Couldn’t sleep.” Merlin perches on the end of his bed, uncertain. “So.” Arthur just looks at him, eyelids heavy with resignation. “You know.” Arthur’s brow is drawn, his lips quirked. “I do.” Merlin licks his lips. “How long?” “I mean, I’ve suspected for months but it was just too preposterous and then I was it directly one night. I really will never understand you Merlin. It shouldn’t even be physically possible.” Merlin stares at him. It’s a longer speech than he’s used to getting from Arthur and he wants to make sure that he’s quite finished. “Is that it? Are you going to do anything?” Arthur cocks his head slightly. “Noo.” Merlin glances at the coverlet and backs up. “Thank you.” And then he’s somehow at Arthur’s side, dragging him out of bed, and pulling him into new clothes, and informing him of the busy day ahead. – Gaius hates it when he gets wind of the situation. “If he knows ,” Merlin argues, “then what does it matter if I do it around him?” “It’s the principle. You can’t get careless Merlin. This is life and death; even if it hasn’t ended disastrously this time, that means nothing for the next time.” Merlin hears the wisdom. He really does. And he tries to heed the older man, most of the time. – After The Eye Incident, his manservant just gets weirder– and more wonderful. For starters, Arthur gets to see the golden eyes far more often. Anytime Merlin cleans or sews or looks for something, his eyes flash and Arthur has to stop what he’s doing to watch. Secondly, the man is madly skilled. He does chores in a fraction of the time Arthur thinks they should take and is able to get stains out of shirts that the scullery maids have given up on, and once, when Arthur complains about the cold water Merlin somehow ensures it stays warm for the rest of his bath. And, in Arthur’s eyes, It’s Just Merlin. Because of course, he can do all of those things. – It’s been long years. Arthur is now king. Uther is gone. Morgana is no longer his. Arthur is alone. Well, not entirely alone Arthur’s lips quirk and Merlin and Gwen burst into the room, laughing to each other. The crown is heavy on his head and this spot of mirth is a rare sight in halls that prepare for a war few expect to survive. Arthur is secluded in his thoughts. A scream tears through the stillness of the room. The three of them run to the window, to find a crowd building in the courtyard. Then they’re running. Merlin is closer to Arthur’s sword, and he grabs it and passes it awkwardly off as they scramble down the dark hallways, shouting at servants to take cover. By the time they make it, Arthur’s knights have assembled, filling the quart yard uncertainly. The creator of the scream hangs seven feet off the ground, face disfigured and dress hanging tattered around her. Behind her, an army of equally disturbing figures stands, waiting for her command. Once Merlin and Arthur make it to the courtyard, (Arthur has long since learned that Merlin refuses to remain in safety.) the witch grins. “Merlin, Merlin, Merlin,” her voice is grating, “just the man I wanted to see.” She laughs shrilly and Arthur winces. He looks at his manservant, confused as to why the witch is so interested in him, though it seems that most of the creatures they fight have an odd fascination with his skinny (er, not now as skinny as he used to be) companion. The crone is speaking again and Arthur drags his attention to the present. “It seems that you have a choice to make.” Her gaze is piercing and Arthur shivers. Beside him, Merlin is stock still. “Either Camelot dies–” She waves her staff and a ball of fire rises from the tip, “or you die at the hands of your beloved king.” Her grin is wide, revealing horrible teeth. Merlin relaxes beside him, ever so slightly, but Arthur is confused. The only thing in the land that holds the death penalty is magic-wielding, a policy left in place from Uther’s reign. And then Merlin, beside him is moving. He looks at the dark-haired man, along with the rest of the knights in the field. They’re all standing stock-still, waiting to see what happens. “Well,” and Merlin, beautiful, blessed idiot that he is, actually grins “you’ve only made one mistake.” Arthur imagines that the witch’s own smile is faltering but he doesn’t dare take his eyes off of the perfect boy in front of him. The air is positively electric. Merlin looks wholly different. There’s something in his veins. He looks as if he could conquer the world. And then, Merlin takes a step. Onto thin air. Arthur stares. “I already have the support of the king of Camelot.” And then Merlin sprints the rest of the way up the nonexistent stairs, reaching long fingers into the sky, closing his eyes and pulling lightning from the clouds above. And Arthur realizes that this is exactly the way Merlin is supposed to look, powerful, strong, with the universe bending around his lithe frame, desperate to please him. Without a moment’s hesitation, Arthur utters the order to charge. His knights attack. Merlin attacks. – The battle was over shockingly fast. The lightning strikes from heaven definitely took the wind out of their sails, Arthur supposes. When Merlin comes down from the air and stands on the pavement again, Arthur grabs Leon’s arm and touches Merlin with it. Satisfied that the man isn’t shocked, Arthur grabs Merlin’s arm and hauls. They stand in Arthur’s room, the place they’ve had so many conversations, arguments, laughs, and even a few, unacknowledged tears. Arthur faces his. “Merlin.” “Arthur.” “That’s all you’ve got?” “Look, I know it wasn’t ideal, but honestly what are you even doing with the magic ban? You obviously don’t believe in it or I would have been in the stocks years ago–” Arthur holds up a finger to stop him. He drags in a deep breath. “Years ago?” Wide-eyed, Merlin nods slowly. “Merlin, how on earth are you figuring that I somehow knew this before today?” Merlin blinks. “You– you didn’t know?” “No, you twat, I didn’t know. Why do you think I did?” Merlin is dumbfounded. “The– my– my eyes,” he’s stammering. “What about them?” “They turn gold.” “Yes, I know that.” A distinctly uncomfortable feeling is curling in the bottom of Arthur’s stomach. He’s cheeks flush slightly at the memory. “Arthur, the eyes of sorcerors turn gold when they practice magic.” It doesn’t even hit him for all of four seconds. When it does, his jaw drops. “I– you– all that time? And you– and I–” He lapses into stunned silence. They stand there for a long time, Arthur growing more and more dazed. Finally, “How was I supposed to know that yellow eyes meant magic? My father forbade anyone of ever speaking about it in my presence.” Merlin chuckles quietly. “I guess I hadn’t thought about that.” “So all this time, you thought I knew.” Merlin nods softly. And then Arthur’s head is snapping up again. “Hang on, this is the first time I’ve seen you practice magic, and yet your eyes are gold every day.” Merlin tilts his head. “Arthur, I’ve been practicing magic in front of you for years.” Arthur shakes his head fervently. “I think I would have noticed.” And then Merlin takes one of Arthur’s calloused hands into his, gently. “Arthur.” And Arthur feels his December-air cold hands begin to warm deliciously, from something that was distinctly not Merlin’s even colder fingers, nor his own body. “This is magic.” The fire behind the boy reaches higher up the wall. “That is magic.” Merlin whispers it against Arthur’s cheek. Beside them, the curtains ruffle slightly. “Magic.” Arthur can feel Merlin’s breath on his cheek. A buckle on his armor comes undone. Merlin doesn’t even say anything, just stands there, clinging to Arthur’s hand, cheek resting against Arthur’s chest plate. Around him, the room is alive. Flowers grow delicately along his mantle, and armor polishes itself. The laundry is being folded by an unseen hand and remaining wrinkles are shaken out of his bed. Arthur feels like he’s being caressed all over. Magic cards through his hair and presses into aching muscles. And suddenly Arthur understands. This magic is like nothing he ever dreamed. He thought it was powerful and bad and made a ruckus, but the way Merlin has been using it, for years is just– Merlin. The tiny comforts and beautiful things about life that Merlin made that way. They weren’t evil, they weren’t even big. They were just Merlin Things. Arthur draws in a deep breath, dangerously close to a cry. Merlin stays where he is. – It’s been two hours. Merlin has been showing Arthur everything he wants to see. He makes a tiny dragon out of magic, and Arthur is mesmerized as it lazily flaps its wings, gliding in circles around the golden head. Merlin smiles up at Arthur, seated in a dining chair. He suddenly has a thought. “Arthur you didn’t know .” Arthur, somewhat begrudgingly, looks away from the dragon toward Merlin before immediately snapping his gaze back. “No yeah, that’s pretty much the whole point.” “You didn’t know and you still ordered the entire Camelot army to back me up.” This time Arthur actually pins his gaze on Merlin. He hasn’t really had time to think about that. “Yeah. I guess I did.” They stare at each other. Arthur is the one to break the silence. “Look, Merlin, it’s you. Magic or no, I trust you, completely. That wasn’t the time for debate, that was the time for trust.” Tears well in Merlin’s eyes and before Arthur knows what’s happening the black-haired bundle is launching itself into his arms with far too much force and their chair is tipping backward and Arthur’s braces for the fall that never comes. When he opens his eyes, they’re levitating a few inches off the ground, Merlin’s arms wrapped around him. Gingerly, he snakes his arms around the boy’s waist. “Merlin, I’ll always choose you.” And the way Merlin nestles perfectly there in his arms, well, that&#x27;s just a Quirky Merlin Thing™.

Notes Notes/Warning: Part of my personal writing Challenge. The prompt Rainbow Kisses is from tumblr. No Archive Warnings Apply. Merlin and Arthur are headed back to their apartment when heavy rain comes out of no where. So they took refuge underneath a dark green awning that lined the storefronts on this street. Arthur glances at Merlin. He looks very good today in his black ensemblebut rumbled, Merlin had just decided to go goth, Arthur’s not sure if that’s not sure if that’s the right word, in his old young age. Curse you modern era for your new way of speaking! Arthur thinks. “Arthur?” Merlin says “You alright?” “Yeah.” He says, “Just tired I guess.” Thinking about what they’ve done today, all the walking, bounding around singing various songs that Arthur doesn’t know the lyrics to quite yet. And is only slightly bummed that he managed to acquire a stain on his favorite pink shirt. “You had fun though right?” Merlin asks a little worry slipping into his voice. “Yeah.” Arthur says giving Merlin a bright smile when he waves the miniature flag he’s holding around. It has the colors of the rainbow on. He can see that Merlin is looking at him intensely. “Don’t be so serious.” Arthur orders voice taking on a tone he hasn’t uttered since back in Camealot, he brushes the tip of the flag against Merlin’s nose. And Merlin goes crosseyed looking at it. “What was that for? Merlin asks confused, pulling back slightly. “Rainbow Kisses.” Arthur says giving the flag another small shake Merlin just smiles at him.</span> <a href="#" class="summary-toggle">[ + ]</a></div><div class="stats"><div class="stat-item"><strong>Rating:</strong> Teen And Up Audiences</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Archive Warning:</strong> No Archive Warnings Apply</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Category:</strong> M/M</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Fandom:</strong> Merlin (TV)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Relationship:</strong> Merlin/Arthur Pendragon (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Character:</strong> Arthur Pendragon (Merlin), Merlin (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Additional Tags:</strong> 100 days challenge, Personal Challenge, Flash Fan Fiction Friday, Pink - Freeform, Tumblr Prompt, rainbow kisses</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Series:</strong> Part 44 of Lrs002’s writing of 2020, Part 20 of 100 Days Challenge</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Published:</strong> 2020-06-26</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Words:</strong> 244</div></div></div><div class="work-entry"><h2 class="title"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://download.archiveofourown.org/downloads/14916675/SPA%20Day.pdf?updated_at=1528944921" target="_blank">SPA Day</a></h2><div class="summary"><span class="summary-short">Arthur, Merlin, and the knights have a SPA Day.

She seemed to have it in for knights, her hands were freezing, and she had deigned to flirt with Merlin, even after Arthur had possessively taken hold of his hand and given her a death glare. “Sorry, Sire. Please forgive me. Mordred told me you liked a deep massage. Was he wrong?” “And why are you taking advice from him?” Arthur asked, scrunching up his nose. Yes, Mordred was right of course—if anyone knew what Arthur liked it would be his former lover—but that was not at all the point. “I informed you exactly what I required when I arrived an hour ago, and this was most certainly not it. Do you not recall that I told you my ribs were tender and to be careful?” Arthur grumbled and looked over at Leon, who was grinning, his eyes closed, his chest slowly rising and falling as his own masseuse rubbed more oils onto his legs, no doubt preparing to begin his second hour of deep-tissue massage. Arthur wanted to throw something and wake him. How dare he leave Arthur to deal with this miscreant alone. Leon was meant to keep him company. Some friend he was! This was Arthur’s first (and last) visit to Secret Pampering Agency, an exclusive club in Camelot for the elite of Albion, but Leon was a frequent visitor and lauded the establishment to all who would listen. In fact, that was the only reason Arthur was here, wasting time that he would never be able to reclaim. “You are finished, unless you have changed your mind and want the full deal like your lovely friend over there,” was her reply, flippant and dismissive. She began entering information onto a piece of parchment and turned her back to him. Arthur was livid, but another glance at Leon had him swallowing his acerbic retort. His fellow knights and servant/lover/best thing that ever happened to Arthur had every right to this day—they worked hard during the week, protecting him and defending the realm against bandits and those others who would see harm come to Camelot. Who was Arthur to stop that just because he was in a strop? Hopefully, Merlin, Gwaine, Elyan, Lancelot and Percival were having a better session than he’d had. He needn’t wonder about Leon—it was evident by the serene expression on his face that he was thoroughly enjoying himself. Merlin had mentioned he wanted a facial, Lancelot was having a mud bath, Gwaine was no doubt making doe eyes at the ladies as they gave him his mani-pedi, and Elyan and Percival were relaxing in the Sauna. Arthur had thought about joining the latter two, but now that he was in such a grumpy mood, he thought he might just leave and go see what was happening in the Rising Sun before returning to the castle. Arthur waited for the girl to leave the room before he rose from the table and began to dress. There was a knock at the door. Who in the hell would knock? “Come in, Merlin,” he said, sighing and rolling his eyes. “What’s got your knickers in such a twist, Princess,” said Gwaine as he entered, followed by Merlin. “Nimueh said you were in a mood and that we should probably hurry and come get you before you scare off the other customers.” How dare she! “She’s one to talk; I gave her specific orders about what to do and she blatantly ignored me.” Gwaine turned to Merlin. “Fancy a bite to eat at the Rising Sun? Dear, delicate Arthur here needs something to eat... and drink,” he added as he winked at Arthur. “The others can join us when they are finished here.” “I don’t know,” Merlin said as he frowned and shook his head exaggeratedly. “He’s being a right git. Should we reward such behaviour?” The laughter in his voice told the real story of how he felt about the situation as he walked up to Arthur and pecked him on the lips before turning back towards Gwaine. “But he’s my right git and I think I’ll keep him.”</span> <a href="#" class="summary-toggle">[ + ]</a></div><div class="stats"><div class="stat-item"><strong>Rating:</strong> Teen And Up Audiences</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Archive Warning:</strong> No Archive Warnings Apply</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Category:</strong> M/M</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Fandom:</strong> Merlin (TV)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Relationship:</strong> Merlin/Arthur Pendragon (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Character:</strong> Arthur Pendragon (Merlin), Merlin (Merlin), Leon (Merlin), Gwaine (Merlin), Knights of the Round Table (Merlin), Nimueh (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Additional Tags:</strong> Grumpy Arthur, Fluff, Canon Era, Spa Treatments, Short &amp; Sweet, Pampering, Alternate Universe - Canon Divergence</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Collections:</strong> Merlin Chat, Camelot Drabble -- Prompt #317: Tender</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Published:</strong> 2018-06-13</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Words:</strong> 718</div></div></div><div class="work-entry"><h2 class="title"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://download.archiveofourown.org/downloads/1150662/Salvation.pdf?updated_at=1390557922" target="_blank">Salvation</a></h2><div class="summary">Merlin and Arthur really are each other&#x27;s Salvation...</div><div class="stats"><div class="stat-item"><strong>Rating:</strong> General Audiences</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Archive Warning:</strong> No Archive Warnings Apply</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Category:</strong> M/M</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Fandom:</strong> Merlin (TV)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Relationship:</strong> Merlin/Arthur Pendragon (Merlin), Merthur, Arlin - Relationship</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Character:</strong> Merlin (Merlin), Arthur Pendragon (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Additional Tags:</strong> Magic, Inspired by Music, Embedded Video, Fanvids</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Published:</strong> 2014-01-24</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Words:</strong> 12</div></div></div><div class="work-entry"><h2 class="title"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://download.archiveofourown.org/downloads/28650888/Sharp%20swords%20and%20soft.pdf?updated_at=1610208051" target="_blank">Sharp swords and soft hearts</a></h2><div class="summary"><span class="summary-short">“Since your return, you’ve collected almost every book in the history of mankind, Arthur.” Merlin sighed. “There’s nothing else you can do apart from learning in the field.” After Arthur&#x27;s return, Merlin and Arthur begin to travel around the world.

During their journey, they&#x27;ll discover more about the modern era and about themselves. Notes Written for week 1 of the Merlin Fic Server Book Club Melee Challenge with prompt “Sword” See the end of the work for more notes “I need to learn everything about this new world, Merlin.” Arthur was sitting cross-legged on the carpet, submerged in one of the books flooding the living room. Merlin pinched the bridge of his nose and looked at him over the stew he was carefully stirring. “Since your return, you’ve collected almost every book in the history of mankind, Arthur.” Merlin sighed. “There’s nothing else you can do apart from learning in the field.” Arthur jumped to his feet and thrust his fist in the air. “Brilliant idea, Merlin! Prepare everything for the journey! We’ll need two strong horses, some supplies…” Arthur continued the list, ignoring Merlin’s groans and the fact that this was the twenty-first century. After that, it took them a couple of months of planning and plotting to begin their journey across the world. Arthur had an inquiring mind, and Merlin was delighted to share his centuries of knowledge with someone so eager to comprehend. “Look, Merlin, finally something that hasn’t changed! A blacksmith!” They were wandering around the old downtown in Florence when a shop window filled with all kinds of swords caught Arthur’s eye (*) “Arthur, wait, that’s not—” Merlin began to say, but the blond one had already put his nose against the glass. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen such finely wrought swords.” Arthur&#x27;s eyes sparkled with joy. &quot;Those aren’t made for fighting,&quot; Merlin walked beside him and smiled fondly. Arthur remained Merlin of a little boy. &quot;People don&#x27;t need swords in the modern world, although I think humankind has become sadly more creative in the ways they kill each other.&quot; “What do people do with those, then?” Arthur protested, pointing at halberds, scimitars and rapiers. “They keep them for fun. They use them for sports. Sometimes, they just hang them in their living rooms,” Merlin explained. Arthur adjusted the lapels of his jacket. &quot;You&#x27;re right, silly of me to think they could create swords like they used to,&quot; the former king reflected. &quot;Let&#x27;s go get some gelato.&quot; Arthur&#x27;s tone was trying to be convincing, but while they were walking, the way he was rubbing his sword arm left Merlin pondering how much Arthur was missing the good old days of training in Camelot. A few hours later, when they were enjoying the sunset over Ponte Vecchio from the balcony of their luxury hotel, Merlin had a eureka moment. “You should try fencing!” “What? Mer lin, I almost spilled this fine wine! Why the hell did you shout like that?” Arthur snapped, jumping on his chair where he was relaxing. He took his sunglasses off and turned to face Merlin, who was standing right outside the glass door with a tray of snacks in his left hand. Merlin didn’t speak for a while, hypnotized by the way Arthur’s figure was silhouetted against the orange and gold light of the sun. “Well, I thought about it, and it could be good for you to have some, uhm, to do something that reminds you of training with the knights,” Merlin stammered. “Do you think I miss training?” Arthur cocked his head. “ Oh , it’s about the swords, isn’t it? No Merlin, you got it wrong. I don’t miss using them. I miss Excalibur.” Arthur looked away. “What do you mean?” Merlin put the tray down and walked closer to his friend. “I know it sounds ridiculous, but I’d like to have it back. I felt a connection with that sword, it was like it was alive. Like we were a team.” Arthur explained. “Do you think I’m weird?” Merlin looked into Arthur’s eyes and trembled from the effort it took not to draw near him and hug him tightly. “No, I don’t think you’re weird,” Merlin breathed. “The way I found Excalibur, the story you told me -even if now I know the truth about it-, well, it gave me hope that maybe I really am destined to do something special. That I really am important,” Arthur confessed, looking anywhere but in Merlin’s direction. Merlin took a deep breath. “Arthur, I’ve been telling you that you’re special for years. How can you still not believe me? You walked out of a lake after decades! My magic came back to me because of your return!” Merlin said. At those words, Arthur gaped and turned towards Merlin, mouth half-opened. “Yes, Arthur, it’s true. After centuries, my magic was beginning to fade. I was even growing tired of it, I was this close to giving up!” Merlin lamented. “Then you came back, and my magic crushed me like a giant wave. But it wasn’t painful at all. Actually, I’ve never felt so alive.” Merlin’s eyes were glistening with little tears that shined like a drop of his magic was hidden inside each of them. Arthur reached out and with his thumb brushed away one of those tears. “Merlin I am sorry, I didn’t mean to doubt you. Sometimes, it’s just hard to have faith in myself, and I’m a silly man to need something tangible to remind me of my worth.” Arthur smiled fondly, and his eyes sparkled with humour. “It should be enough to hear you describe me like one of the superheroes of your comic books.” Merlin let out a short, feeble laugh. “I won’t do that again! We both know your head is already as big as your waist.” Arthur nudged his shoulder and as the sun disappeared behind the horizon, they looked towards their future together with newly blossomed hope.

It&#x27;s my first attempt to publish something like this, but I adore these two idiots too much to not try. Day 1: small kisses littered across the other’s face He was alive. Arthur was alive and breathing right in front of him, and this time it wasn&#x27;t an hallucination. Oh, how many times Merlin has dreamed of this moment! He even took some drugs to induce his mind to see what was really happening right now. He used old and dark spells to create some kind of image that could be at least an echo of the man standing there, near the lake Merlin has guarded for so many years. But nothing could compare to Arthur looking at him like that, is armour and chainmail all wet, his hair looking even more blond in the bright light of an early summer morning. Merlin felt paralyzed, like a thousand chains hold his arms and legs in place, he felt like he couldn&#x27;t even blink. So it was Arthur who had to do the first move, always the bravest, always the most passionate man: he took Merlin&#x27;s face between his hands and after giving him his warmest smile, he began to cover every inch of Merlin&#x27;s face with tiny kisses. &quot;They told me everything&quot; kiss &quot;I am so sorry you had to wait so long&quot; kiss &quot;I missed you so much&quot; kiss &quot;Oh God I was an idiot back then&quot; kiss &quot;I know everything now&quot; kiss &quot;Please don&#x27;t cry&quot; kiss &quot;I know&quot; kiss And they stood there, in a tight embrace, until Merlin discovered he could speak again, but the only word he could say, like a whispered prayer, was &quot;Arthur.

Arthur accidentally eavesdrops. Notes For the tenth anniversary of the final, I decided to translate my first fanfic. It was written a very long time ago and is completely silly. But that&#x27;s how my adventure in writing fanfic began. See the end of the work for more notes Something more Arthur strode swiftly towards the physician’s chambers. He was - to put it mildly - irritated. Really, if this idiot is late again, he will bitterly regret it. He will already teach him to reason. Tomorrow, first thing in the morning, they&#x27;re going hunting and if he doesn&#x27;t come on time this time, he&#x27;ll be cleaning the stable every day for a month. He also considered the possibility of putting him in stocks, but finally rejected it, because then he would have no use for him. Alternatively, one could still.... The prince stopped abruptly, a few steps from the door. He had been so engrossed in devising the most varied punishments for his wayward servant that he had completely failed to notice what was going on around him. Now, however, something caught his attention. He didn’t know whether he had imagined it or heard someone&#x27;s raised voice. No. It didn&#x27;t occur to him. Someone was shouting and that someone was... Merlin? He found that a little strange. Merlinn, ofcourse could argue quite well, but he hadn’t yet heard him so angry. - But it is so, Gaius! - came from outside the door. - Always! Arthur, after some thought, decided that it would be wisest to wait a while. Apparently Merlin had already managed to annoy more than just him first thing in the morning. He wasn&#x27;t in the habit of eavesdropping, but for some unspecified reason, his feet had grown into the floor. „Merlin!” It was Gaius, contrary to the prince’s prediction, not angry at all. More... worried? What could have happened there? „Oh, stop it! Don&#x27;t say anything! Just... say no more”! „Merlin! You know that…” „I have no strength left! Do you understand!? I have no strength”! „I know how you feel”! „You don&#x27;t know! How would you know”!? Arthur felt strange. This definitely didn&#x27;t seem like an argument over an uncleaned leech tank. Really, he wanted to back away, but his stubborn legs didn’t want to move. „I live in this world for a while”! „But you&#x27;re not me”! „Merlin, for heaven’s sake, keep your voice down! The whole of Camelot can hear you”! „Very well! Let it hear! I don’t care about it”! „Please, calm down”, said Gaius a little more quietly. Then a few words were said which Arthur didn’t understand, but apparently they irritated Merlin even more. „Leave me alone”! he shouted, already almost on the verge of hysteria. „Everything I do, I do wrong”! Again a few quiet, presumably intended soothing words and another shriek. „No, and don&#x27;t try to convince me otherwise”! „Merlin, please”! Desperation could clearly be heard in Gaius&#x27; tone. „Control yourself”. „I am completely in control”! The door opened impetuously and Merlin fell out of the chamber. He closed them no less violently and only then did he see the prince. Astonishment mixed with horror was painted on his face. In a &quot;normal&quot; situation, Arthur would probably have been amused, but this was definitely not normal. „My lord”, whispered Merlin. He was breathing rapidly. He looked as if he was about to cry. „What’s happened”? Arthur asked. „Nothing. I&#x27;m sorry I&#x27;m late”. „And because of nothing you&#x27;re yelling at Gaius like a man possessed”? Artur looked at him sternly. „That&#x27;s... not important”. The boy leaned against the wall. „Not important? I suppose you haven&#x27;t cleaned up, or gone to fetch ingredients? Indeed, that&#x27;s like you”. „Yeah, exactly”. Merlin put his arms around himself. He wasn’t looking at the prince, but at some unspecified point above his head. He was trembling slightly. „Are you making a fool of me? Perhaps I shouldn&#x27;t have heard it, but as Gaius rightly pointed out, I think the whole of Camelot heard you, so you can&#x27;t hold it against anyone. And I didn&#x27;t like what I heard at all”. Merlin went even paler. „Forgive me, sire”, he said coolly. „You&#x27;re a complete fool! You don&#x27;t apologise me, just tell me what’s happened”! Arthur was beginning to lose patience. Merlin in this guise frightened him. He had always felt that underneath that mask of a happy-go-lucky idiot there was something indecipherable, but he had never expected to hear such bitterness, such pain, such resignation in his voice. He constantly had the feeling that he was missing something and it irritated him more and more. For quite a long time he had thought that Merlin didn&#x27;t share his concerns with him because he simply didn&#x27;t have them, but eventually he realised how wrong he was. The event of a moment ago seemed to confirm this. Arthur - though he obviously wasn&#x27;t going to admit it - was very keen for Merlin to trust him. - So? - he urged him. „It&#x27;s really nothing worth of your worrying, my lord”. „Let me be the judge of that”. „Oh, I just... I don&#x27;t want to talk about it. Not today”. „Okey, all right”, muttered Arthur. It was always like that. He would reach out to him, but Merlin would run away, and then talk about how the prince was supposedly insensitive, selfish… Generally, he had a few of his favourite epithets with which he frequented him quite regularly. Arthur no longer really understood what he was doing wrong. Gwen... She would probably know. They stood in silence for a while. Merlin was slowly calming down. Arthur felt embarrassed, so he thought it best if he returned to familiar ground. „Merlin”, he began. „I heard you shouting that you were doing everything wrong. That&#x27;s not entirely true”. „No”? „No. You make an idiot of yourself masterfully”. Merlin didn&#x27;t smile, but at least he didn&#x27;t seem so tense anymore. „’Today&#x27;s the horse fair”, Arthur said after a while. „Come on, let&#x27;s pick you a gelding. That your mare deserves some peace and quiet in her old age”. „What”, the boy looked at him in amazement. „Don&#x27;t you know what a gelding is? Ok, I&#x27;ll explain it to you”. „I know what’s…” Merlin finally burst into laughter. It&#x27;s nothing if it&#x27;s a bit nervous. It&#x27;s always some progress. They moved together towards the exit. The day was very pleasant. Not sunny, in truth, but warm. It looked like the whole week would be nice, just in time for a longer hunt. But for now... screw the hunt. You can always go after tomorrow. Because Merlin&#x27;s shouted, &quot;I&#x27;ve got no strength left!&quot; somehow couldn&#x27;t get out of his head. There was something more than simple anger in it. Something that shouldn&#x27;t be there, and Arthur had sworn to himself that one day he would find out.

A lot of snow has fallen at my place; it reaches halfway up calves, making it difficult for me to even go out for a walk with my dog. But I like winter nonetheless.

Mostly they&#x27;re just baffled. Merlin is trying, okay, but he&#x27;s annoyed at Arthur and still recovering from dragon speak. Notes See the end of the work for notes The knights were further up the trail than Arthur and Merlin. The king and his manservant were arguing about servant pay. None of the knights would butt in. Either because they didn&#x27;t want to get between the two, or because they had no idea how to add to the conversation. Then, out of nowhere, Merlin started to look around. Arthur noticed it, like the amazing king he was. &quot;Hear a rabbit in the bushes, Merlin?&quot; he asked. Merlin turned from him in annoyance but kept his eyes surveying the surroundings. Gwaine, ever the man, said, &quot;It&#x27;s not bandits, is it?&quot; Elyan snorted. &quot;No, no. It&#x27;s Morgana.&quot; &quot;Incorrect,&quot; said Lancelot, &quot;it&#x27;s a beast with sharp talons.&quot; Mordred added, &quot;Maybe an assassin.&quot; Leon sighed. &quot;Please don&#x27;t jinx it.&quot; Arthur looked at his knights in confusion. He asked, &quot;Is there some sort of inside joke going on?&quot; Percival looked at the blond. He spoke, &quot;Sire, every time Merlin gets a feeling, he&#x27;s right. Something bad happens every time.&quot; Arthur squawked. &quot;It does not! He gets a bad feeling every five minutes.&quot; Merlin glared at the king. &quot;An oaf like you wouldn&#x27;t notice.&quot; Arthur replied, &quot;And a farm boy like you could never believe the skills I have.&quot; &quot;Ah, trained since birth to kill, huh. Haven&#x27;t heard that in a while.&quot; Arthur replied, &quot;At least no one else here was arrested moments after coming to Camelot.&quot; Gwaine raised his eyebrows in amusement. Merlin… arrested? What for? He noticed that the other knights had turned to Leon for answers, though the head knight offered not a thing. &quot;You&#x27;re the one that chased me with a mace. Gwen still teases me about it. It&#x27;s been years!&quot; said Merlin. &quot;Those were the days, weren&#x27;t they,&quot; Arthur replied. &quot;You were in the stocks, I was still respected by my servants, and Gaius didn&#x27;t yell at me every week.&quot; &quot;You deserve his eyebrow look.&quot; Gwaine whispered, &quot;What is happening?&quot; The other knights agreed. Mordred asked loudly, &quot;Do you think we can get a move on? I&#x27;d like to get home before dark.&quot; Arthur shuffled. &quot;Let&#x27;s move on, men.&quot; Merlin frowned. He didn&#x27;t like it. And, of course, Merlin was right. The knights walked into a trap. Merlin held Arthur back from the circle that lit underneath their feet. The knights barely noticed anything was wrong until they turned around to see no Merlin or Arthur. Gwaine said nonchalantly, &quot;Magic?&quot; Leon sighed. &quot;Probably,&quot; he answered. &quot;To Camelot first?&quot; asked Percival. &quot;Yeah,&quot; Leon confirmed. &quot;We&#x27;re almost there. We&#x27;ll ask Gaius what to do.&quot; For about an hour, they walked. Honestly, they were too used to everything going wrong at this point. They made it to the castle, getting many strange looks along the way. They went to undress their chainmail and lay down their weapons. It was then they ran into Merlin. Leon called out, &quot;Merlin, is everything alright?&quot; The Merlin that looked up to them from sharpening a sword was very different. Younger, for one. Naive-looking, too. The ravenette looked spooked. He flailed a tad, setting the sword down with a clang. Odd, but it could just be because they went missing or something. Merlin stood up. Be replied, &quot;Is something wrong… sir?&quot; &quot;Uh,&quot; said Leon eloquently, &quot;no. Thanks for your time.&quot; Leon quickly turned around and grabbed onto Gwaine to do the same. The knights turned to go, but one was left behind. Lancelot didn&#x27;t escape the room. Merlin looked at Lancelot strangely. &quot;What are you going here?&quot; he asked. Lancelot shut the door. He stepped closer. He backed Merlin into the corner. Merlin was very weirded out. Lancelot exhaled, &quot;Magic. Something with magic. Have you done anything?&quot; Merlin stuttered, &quot;Uh… no? Never. I&#x27;ve been, uhm, busy. In fact, I recently got back from visiting my mother.&quot; &quot;Oh,&quot; said Lancelot. &quot;That&#x27;s nice. How is Hunith?&quot; Merlin gave him a suspicious look. &quot;Did I tell you her name?&quot; &quot;No. You didn&#x27;t, I don&#x27;t believe. A future you might have, though. Time travel. Yep. Normal. Is Gaius around?&quot; Merlin paused. &quot;Time travel?&quot; &quot;Mmn.&quot; &quot;Is the future shit, then? Did I fail my destiny?&quot; &quot;No,&quot; Lancelot said firmly. &quot;You&#x27;re doing great. Arthur&#x27;s king, in fact.&quot; &quot;That&#x27;s good. Really good. He&#x27;s a prat, but I&#x27;m starting to like him.&quot; Lancelot gave a comforting pat. &quot;You&#x27;re great, Merlin, no matter what the bloody dragon says.&quot; &quot;You know about the dragon?&quot; he asked meekly. &quot;I know everything,&quot; Lancelot confirmed. Merlin bit his lip. He asked hesitantly, &quot;Can you meet me in my room tonight? After dinner. Or we can eat dinner together? I need your opinion on something.&quot; &quot;I&#x27;ll be there,&quot; Lancelot promised. There was a pregnant silence. Merlin asked, &quot;Were the others also time travelers?&quot; &quot;Uh, yeah. We&#x27;re all friends. You&#x27;re a very good friend to them, and vice versa. We have a lot of fun.&quot; &quot;Cool. Cool. Cool. Totally normal.&quot; &quot;It kind of is.&quot; Merlin screamed internally. The future might not be shit, but it was definitely bizarre. Merlin said, &quot;Okay. I&#x27;m guessing Sir… Leon? Is that his name? Is from the future, but his current counterpart is still out there. He&#x27;s, uh, out on a quest, I think. If he&#x27;s seen, it could be bad. You might want to find him a disguise… and the others, are they current knights?” “Nope. The rest shouldn’t be anywhere near here.” “That’s good, I think.” “Yep.” “....” “How long ago was the griffin attack? I assume that’s what you know me from.” “Oh,” said Merlin, “a few months ago. A lot’s happened since then, but, uh, it’s nice knowing that you know stuff.” “Stuff,” Lancelot repeated. “Yeah.” Lancelot sighed. He put the sword Merlin had out away carefully before getting out of his chainmail. Once he was dressed down and looked more like an average citizen of Camelot, he peeked his head outside of the room. Lancelot called out to the waiting future knights of Camelot, “Get changed, quickly.” The rest of the knights rushed in. They undressed while Merlin stood next to Lancelot in the corner. Merlin commented, “They’re much better at this step than Arthur.” “He kinda gets better at it, but don’t expect much,” replied Lancelot. The two exchanged a grin. Gwaine, now looking more peasant-like, announced, “So, where are we? And why is Merlin acting different?” “Time travel,” Lancelot supplied. “Time travel,” Mordred repeated. “Time travel.” Leon said, “Could be worse, I guess. Everyone’s alive.” Merlin said awkwardly, “You don’t know that.” Heads swooshed to him. “I- I mean, technically your past counterparts could be dead. Or by meeting your counterparts you rip apart the universe.” “Such a downer,” complained Percival with a teasing tone. “Cheer up, Merlin,” said Gwaine, “you got a bunch of knights around to send back home.” Merlin’s frown increased. He exited without a witty remark. The knights turned to Lancelot for answers. Lancelot shook his head. He didn’t know everything, clearly, but he could pretend to for a while if it helped Merlin. As they cleared out of the room, dressed as peasants, Lancelot remarked, “We need to get Leon a hat. He’s supposedly out on a quest. It’d be weird if he was around.” With that, they made their way to Gaius’s. They were just about to get to the physicians when Gwen came down the hallway. She carried a few herbs in a basket, and had an extra bump in her step. She paused when she saw them moments from the door. Gwen asked, “Are any of you injured?” “Just visiting,” replied Percival calmly. “Oh,” she said, “Gaius or Merlin?” “Both.” “Well, come on, then, get in.” The group was ushered inside. Gwen followed after them. She laid the basket full of herbs down onto a table just as Gaius turned around. Merlin came out of his room with a book that most of them hadn’t seen before. Gaius still looked a tad confused. He asked, “Are you sick? If so, please sit down.” “Gaius, these are the time travelers,” Merlin reminded quietly. “Oh, right. Of course. Sit down anyway.” The knights did as instructed. Gwen furrowed her brow in confusion when she saw Lancelot and Elyan. Leon wasn’t too odd to be around. The others she didn’t recognize. “Did you say time travel?” asked Gwen. Merlin moved to stand beside her, the book plopping right in front of them. He answered, “Yep. It was apparently magic, meaning only magic can reverse it.” “Magic,” Gwen said hesitantly. “Been happening a lot around here, huh.” “Yes,” she confirmed. After a moment she said, “Is that why Elyan is here? And Lancelot too?” “Apparently they’re knights.” “Knights?” “And Arthur’s king.” “Woah.” “Yeah.” Gwen asked, “Think he’s any good at it? You said he still needs help picking out a shirt.” “I mean, Lancelot was knighted, so he must be somewhat good,” Merlin replied. “Right…” Gaius raised his brows towards them. They shushed immediately. “Now,” announced Gaius, “what were you all doing at the time you noticed something was wrong?” Leon answered, “We were returning from a patrol. It was a short-lived patrol, and only lasted a couple of days. Things were too quiet, you see. Anyway, we were walking, and then suddenly Arthur and Merlin weren’t behind us anymore. We decided to come here and get help.” “Instead we learned we time traveled,” added Mordred. “Very complicated. Only someone with a lot of power can do that.” Gaius agreed with a hum. “Very powerful and high level. Perhaps Nimueh?” He turned to Merlin. “She could be responsible.” Lancelot chimed in, “She’s dead.” “Oh,” said Gaius, “I guess not her then. Are there any other high priestess around?” “Yes.” “Explain?” “If we tell her identity, things may go wrong.” “I know that boy,” said Gaius. “Tell me about her level. Has she done complicated magic before? Does she have the resources?” “She could,” answered Leon. “We believe she has a spy within our midst, but we are unable to figure it out.” Gaius hummed. He turned to Merlin once more. “See if you can find anything in your book. If not, go to the library. I’ll talk to Uther on the matter.” Gaius began to move when Lancelot stopped him. Gaius raised his eyebrow at the other. “Please don’t. It won’t look good upon Arthur. Can we keep this a secret?” Gaius looked at the knights. He swayed on his side a tad. “Fine,” the physician answered. “But one of you must clean out the leech tank while Merlin searches.” Merlin beamed. The knights revolted. In the end, Elyan was offered up. Gaius showed him to the tank. His sacrifice was greatly loved. Meanwhile, Gwen looked at the book Merlin was flipping through. It was odd. The other knights noticed it too, but stayed in their seats in fear that Gaius would have a chore for them to do. Gwen voiced, “What language is that?” “Latin,” the manservant replied casually. “Oh. I didn’t know you could read Latin.” “It’s weird.” “I could only imagine.” “Mmn.” Gwen bit her lip. She asked, “Is it magic?” “Yeah,” Merlin confirmed. If anyone noticed his grip tighten around the edges of the paper, no one said a word. “Fight magic with magic?” “Like I said, it’s becoming a normal thing.” “And if Uther found out?” “He’d most likely chop off all our heads.” “Huh. Quite a risk taker, then?” Merlin replied, “Always.” He then dove more into his book as Gwen looked at him with a smile etched on her face. “Oh my god,” whispered Gwaine to the knights. “Guinevere has a crush on Merlin.” “The Queen had a crush on Merlin,” Percival echoed. “Arthur’s wife and servant had an affair,” Mordred added. “Oh my god. Leon. Why didn’t you tell us?” Gwaine asked. Leon sighed at them. “Nothing came of it. It was mostly one-sided, anyway. Merlin was oblivious.” The knights turned to the two servants. Gwen was quite close to Merlin as he continued with whatever magic thing he was reading. “Yep, I believe it. Not far-fetched at all.” Percival added, “So obvious.” “Kind of cute,” Mordred commented. “Two servants fall in love.” “A king and a servant is more legendary,” Leon said. Elyan returned with small round marks along his cheeks. He sat down with a large thump and a glare. Gwen looked over, then, and let out a giggle. Merlin looked up and seemed smug. Elyan asked, “What are we whispering about?” “Just that Gwen has a crush on Merlin,” replied Gwaine. “Oh. That. I knew. She has one on Lancelot later.” “You’re taking this too well. Merlin could be you in-law.” Elyan shrugged. “Both options I’m fine with.” It was then that stomps could be heard. Everyone’s head jerked towards the door where a prince entered. Without looking up, he yelled, “Merlin, you were supposed to be… oh. Is there a sickness going around? Do we have to torch a creature again? Poison? Raiders?” “Just a classic case of time travel, sire,” Merlin replied with a whim. “Oh. Okay. You’re busy then… Time travel?” questioned Arthur. “Yeah. ‘Parently you’re king and you let them fall into a sorcerer’s trap. It sent them back in time.” Arthur looked abashed. He inspected the men. “Nope. Only a few of them have noble traits. It’s not allowed.” “Again, I said you’re the king in their future.” At that, Arthur widened his eyes. He awed quietly, “Commoners are allowed to be knighted?” “Your rules.” Merlin shrugged casually. He closed the book in front of him and sighed. “I’m going to the library to see if Geoffrey has anything magic related on hand.” Arthur processed his words, then yelped, “Everything magic related was burned.” “Don’t believe everything your daddy tells you, prat,” Merlin replied with a tone most knights hadn’t heard from him, even in the future. He left the physicians quarters with a slight slam of the door. Arthur winced noticeably. Gwen didn’t seem too put-off. In fact, Gwen seemed to agree with Merlin. Gwen greeted, “Sire.” Arthur looked at her. “Yes?” Gwen sighed. “Your knights need help to return home. It’s believed a high priestess, meaning someone incredibly powerful in magic, performed the spell. We’ll need someone with equal power to reverse it… or so we think.” “Magic is outlawed,” the prince stated bluntly. “Do you want your future, loyal knights not to return home? Some king you are.” Arthur blanched. He turned to her. “Guinevere, I only did what was right.” “That man was Merlin’s best friend. He saved everyone, and you burned him.” “He was a sorcerer.” “And not just that, you lit him up when he was already dying from protecting you.” Gwen left after her last burst. Arthur looked lost and confused. He turned to the knights. He said, “So you all know what happened, don’t you? The future and all.” “Say it in your own words, sire,” urged Leon gracefully. Arthur sighed a heaved breath. “I burned Merlin’s best friend at the stake because he was a sorcerer. It started with raiders, and a good mission to help Merlin out. We went. Morgana, Guinevere, and I, and helped defeat the raiders with Merlin. But then Merlin’s best friend did magic, and by law he had to be burned.” “Ouch,” commented Gwaine. “No wonder they hate you.” Arthur blubbered on before moving past it. “How am I supposed to help with this situation? Where’s Gaius?” “He said something about collecting ingredients,” said Elyan. Leon moved forward. “Sire, you can help us by keeping our identities a secret. We, uh, would like you not to tell your father about any of this.” “Not tell my father,” Arthur repeated. “Why not?” Merlin chose than time to walk in. He had a stack of fancy-looking books with him. Merlin said, “Cause it would make you look bad.” “Didn’t know you cared, Merlin,” the blond replied. Merlin didn’t reply. Instead, he unstacked the books and looked over their titles. All seemed to be in Latin. Merlin asked the room, “How many of you can read Latin?” Leon was the only one who stepped forward. A moment later Gwaine did also. “Great,” said Merlin, “help me find the right spell.” He handed out two books to them each. “Nice to have some help that’s not Gaius and his judging eyebrows. Just remember not to say any of the words out loud, and you’ll be fine.” Leon looked down to his books. He seemed hesitant. “These are spell books,” the head-knight said. “Yep. Lancelot said you all are from the future, so you all should know things. How you survive without any magic information is practically impossible. Everything magical has to be killed with magic.” “They didn’t know that part, Merlin,” said Lancelot. “Oh.” Merlin swayed foot to foot. “Well, I’m sure you can help anyways. Cabbage-head, can you read Latin or not?” He looked at Arthur. “I can read it,” he confirmed. “Then help,” Merlin heaved. He gave the smallest book to the prince. “For your tiny brain.” “You can’t talk to me like that,” said Arthur. Merlin rolled his eyes and started on his stack of 4 books. Percival, Lancelot, Mordred, and Elyan sat awkwardly. Eventually Merlin gave them an unimpressed look. Lancelot stood up and got closer to where Merlin was stationed. Lancelot said, “Any ideas how to get back?” Merlin sat up. “Maybe,” he replied. “Usually there has to be some sort of beacon, or, well, a magical object that helps move the process along. And Gaius mentioned that pentagrams are how people travel to the future, so we may be looking for one of those.” “A pentagram?” questioned Gwaine. He flipped his book pages to them. “Like this?” Merlin took the book from Gwaine quickly, almost running to get it. He nodded along, reading the language and diagrams quickly. Merlin said, “This is probably what sent you here.” He flipped the pages. “Yes. This is how to reverse it. Let’s hope it’s doable. If it requires a sacrifice… which it does not, great. Let’s do it.” “You seem to know a lot about magic,” said Elyan. Merlin shrugged. “When you’re born with uncontrollable magic, you do what you can.” Silence. Complete silence. “What?” asked Arthur quietly. Merlin flickered his eyes up. He said, “I admitted it to the court when Gwen was accused, and no one believed me. It’s not my fault for that, now is it?” Everyone was speechless. The only sound was Merlin flipping pages and Lancelot trying to contain his laughs. “You have magic?” Merlin looked at the knights. All of them, including Arthur. “Yes. I thought that was fairly obvious, seeing as I had a spell book in my room. Catch up, will you? If I’m still alive in the future, I’m sure people have accepted it. I bet that dragon was wrong.” “Dragon,” said Leon. “You know the dragon?” “The one underneath the castle? Yeah. Annoying. Always talking about killing Uther. Incredibly cryptic too. Worst dragon ever. Always talking into my mind.” Gwaine asked excitingly, “You know a dragon?” “He’s horrible,” said Merlin. “Says there’s a prophecy about Arthur becoming the greatest king ever in history, talks about how this one kid, Mordred, is destined to kill him, and that Morgana is a witch that I’m doomed to kill.” The knights hushed at that. Lancelot said, “Merlin, we’ve talked about this, the dragon fucked you up. Don’t believe everything it says.” “It’s, like, a million years old and sees into the future. How am I supposed to annoy him?” asked Merlin in outrage. “He says all of these things I hate to do, but it’s all bullshit. But I can’t get him to leave me alone. Did you know he and druids can talk into your mind? Horrible, right?” “Very horrible,” Lancelot said blandly. “But, Merlin, the future&#x27;s looking good. You did good.” Merlin rolled his eyes towards the book. “I did great alright,” he said. “I let my friends fall into a trap. Great. Such a good warlock I am.” “You’re an amazing warlock,” Lancelot said firmly. “The best around.” “Can- Can we get back to how I’m supposed to kill Arthur?” asked Mordred in worry. Merlin looked spooked once more as he laid eyes upon the youngest knight. “Yikes,” commented Gwaine. Merlin looked very awkward. Usually Merlin was somewhat confident, so it was strange to see. Merlin answered, “The druid boy Mordred is supposedly destined to kill Arthur, so, uh, I, uh, gave up after I learned that. It’s my destiny to protect Arthur, so I had to choose.” Mordred processed the words quietly while Arthur seemed to roar with fire. Arthur asked, “Your destiny? Your destiny is to protect me? You’re just a servant.” His voice was laced with confusion. Merlin huffed. Mordred was the one who spoke up. He said, “Sire, please calm down. Emrys shouldn’t be undermined.” “Emrys?” echoed Percival in awe. He turned to Mordred. “Are you saying Merlin is Emrys.” “Uh, yeah. Thought that was obvious.” “Who exactly is Emrys?” asked Elyan. “The most powerful sorcerer that will ever walk upon Earth,” the druid answered. “Uh, really?” asked Merlin. “You sure about that? Completely sure?” “Uhm, yep. Pretty sure. You’re the most powerful sorcerer, and Arthur will be the greatest king time will ever know.” “Fuck that,” Merlin whispered as he looked down to the book from his chair. He was pointedly ignoring everyone else. “What the hell?” questioned Arthur. The rest in the room agreed with his sentiment. Gwen entered moments later. Gaius followed behind her. Merlin showed Gaius the book. They conversed quietly for a few moments. Gaius announced a bit later, “The spell might not work, but we’ll try. Arthur, please step away from our time travelers.” Arthur did as instructed. Gaius looked at him approvingly. He started to grind a few things together when he had a look come across his face. Gaius asked, “No secrets of the future or past were revealed, correct?” Silence. Gaius sighed. He stopped mixing and turned his eyebrows on everyone. “You ruined the timeline then. This spell is useless. I should have mentioned that before.” “You think?” asked Arthur. “Not now, boy,” Gaius commented. “I need to warn you all of what will come.” “What will come?” asked Leon. Gaius straightened up. “The timeline will try to repair itself.” Then the world was lit in a bright light. Leon opened his eyes to Gareth and Bors looking at him strangely. They were younger, so he was obviously still in the past. Leon stood up. Bors said, “Worried us there for a moment. Fell off your horse. You alright?” “Fine,” Leon replied. “How far away from Camelot are we, again?” “A couple days&#x27; ride,” Gareth said. He looked forlorn. “The quest was a fail. No monsters to slay.” “Probably a good thing,” said Bors. “Yes,” Leon agreed. “A good thing.” Quietly, like a nagging in the back of his head, Leon wondered what the hell was happening. He wasn’t the only one. The rest of the so-called time travelers were in similar situations.

Notes So, in chat yesterday we were talking about tea. I mentioned sweet tea, that in Texas we generally drink tea sweet and cold. This started a discussion of hot tea and sweet tea. So today this idea popped into my head and i had to write it! I did a bit of research on the origins of tea and discovered that in the beginning it was quite bitter, so I have incorporated that, but I do not think hot tea is bitter at all. Disclaimer : Merlin is not mine. At all. I write this all for fun and will make no money from it. “You know I love you, Merlin, and I am up for almost anything you want me to try, but I think this is where I must draw the line,” Arthur said as soon as he swallowed. “What is this?” he added with a grimace as he set down the goblet. The last time he had tasted something similar had been when he was a child. He vaguely recalled that he had liked whatever it had been, but this, well, it was absolutely not to his liking. At all. The unfortunate explosion of richness lingered. And it had been cold. Absolutely revolting. Arthur fervently wished for something to wash away the aftertaste. Preferably, glorious, hot tea. “It’s called sweet tea, Arthur,” Merlin answered cheerfully, a huge grin on his face. “Like it?” Arthur harrumphed. “This,” he said, looking at the goblet as if it had insulted him, which, really, it had, “is not tea, Merlin, and no, I do not like it,” he replied petulantly. “I asked for tea. You know, that glorious bitter concoction every child is exposed to as soon as they are weaned? This tripe here, well, I don’t know what you call it, but it most certainly is not tea.” Merlin retrieved the goblet and shrugged as he turned and walked towards the door. “Fine, I’ll go make your usual bitter tea, sire.” Arthur could hear the condescension in Merlin&#x27;s voice, and had he muttered bitter tea for a bitter prince as he opened the door? It certainly had sounded like it. “What was that, Merlin?” he asked authoritatively. Merlin turned back towards Arthur and sneered. “Better tea for a better prince, sire,” he said innocently, and the fake grin that followed actually made Arthur laugh, which seemed to further irritate Merlin. “Not that you asked, but since you seem so very curious about this new way to make tea, sire , let me regale you with how I came up with it. I was working on a medicinal recipe for Gaius the other day when I accidentally spilled sweet herbs into the freshly boiled tea. I went to throw it out later that evening, but I decided to try it, just to see what it would taste like, and when I did I found it quite to my liking. In fact, I prefer it.” Merlin followed this pronouncement with a genuine smile. Just why he had to go and do that, Arthur wasn’t sure, but what Arthur did know was that Merlin and disarming smiles always equalled an Arthur that could not stay upset with Merlin, no matter how much he wanted to. Arthur snorted, amused. “Of course you would try something without thinking about the possible ramifications. You are a true child, Merlin. When I was a young boy I also enjoyed the sweeter concoctions, but there comes a time when we must all move on. I have moved on,” he added as he rolled his eyes. “I asked Gaius to try it and he said it was good. Sweet things are not only for children, Arthur,” Merlin said churlishly. “He thinks this sweet tea could catch on.” “Oh good gods, please no,” Arthur groused, thinking that the world had gone mad. “Well, what you do in your own time is your business, Merlin, but if you make me this ghastly drink you call sweet tea ever again, I might have to rethink our future, and I really do not want to do that as I have grown quite fond of you,” he added as he walked over to Merlin and pressed a quick kiss to his lips. Merlin licked his lips and sighed happily as Arthur stepped back. “Not to worry, Arthur. You will never again be subjected to my sweet tea. I can promise you that. I would hate to lose you. The same as you, I have grown quite fond of you, and,” Merlin paused for several seconds as he winked at Arthur, “more sweet tea for me.” After another huge grin, Merlin left.</span> <a href="#" class="summary-toggle">[ + ]</a></div><div class="stats"><div class="stat-item"><strong>Rating:</strong> General Audiences</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Archive Warning:</strong> No Archive Warnings Apply</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Category:</strong> M/M</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Fandom:</strong> Merlin (TV)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Relationship:</strong> Merlin/Arthur Pendragon (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Character:</strong> Merlin (Merlin), Arthur Pendragon (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Additional Tags:</strong> Fluff, Short &amp; Sweet, Canon Era, Merlin invents sweet tea, the things we come up with when chatting with others!</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Published:</strong> 2020-12-10</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Words:</strong> 671</div></div></div><div class="work-entry"><h2 class="title"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://download.archiveofourown.org/downloads/12856551/Thats%20Only%20Fair.pdf?updated_at=1532524741" target="_blank">That&#x27;s Only Fair</a></h2><div class="summary"><span class="summary-short">Arthur, Merlin, Percival and Lancelot stopped to an inn for the night in the middle of some quest, and the king and his knight are having great fun teasing Merlin.

Notes Hello! I found out that little &quot;gem&quot; Inside my phone... Actually I wrote it months ago and I totally forgot about it hum Anyway, this is the result of a diner with some frinds of mine during which we were kind of roleplaying the show (I was Merlin hehe) and we had so much fun that I just wrote it aftermath... Except for the ending, it&#x27;s all from our roleplay ^^&#x27; And please please forgive my mistakes :( See the end of the work for more notes The taverne was crowded and utterly noisy and Merlin hardly frayed his way to the table. When he finally arrived Arthur exclaimed : « Finally! I thought we&#x27;d lost you forever! » « Sorry, there are so much people out there, I couldn&#x27;t be quicker. » Merlin poured beer into Arthur&#x27;s, Lancelot&#x27;s and Percival&#x27;s glasses and then pour some for himself in his own goblet and went to sit next to Arthur. But the young king stopped him: « What do you think you&#x27;re doing? » « Er... sit and have a beer? » Merlin answered. « With us? » Arthur replied. Merlin first frowned and then smiled. « Yes? » he said slowly. He looked at his three companions with raised eyebrows. « I don&#x27;t think so. » Arthur answered sternly. &quot;You&#x27;re just a servant, you can&#x27;t sit with us.&quot; « What? » Merlin turned his gaze to the other two waiting for them to say something, but Percival was kind of hiding behind his goblet and Lancelot seemed determined not to look at him. Arthur resumed: « Theorically, you should be eating on the floor, but since it would be quite inconvenient here I simply suggest you find another table. » « You&#x27;re not serious, are you? » Merlin asked with a smile. « Are you? » he repeated his smile fading away. He turned towards Percival and Lancelot but they were still avoiding his gaze. Actually, they were trying hard not to laugh at Merlin&#x27;s face of disbelief, especially when Arthur snarled: « Come on Merlin, off you go. » « You&#x27;re joking. » Merlin said, looking into Arthur’s eyes. « Do I look like someone joking? » Arthur replied with his sternest attitude. Merlin opened his mouth as to say something, but instead of it he took his glass and went to go away. But Arthur seized his arm and say: « Come on, don’t be silly, sit down. You may stay. » Merlin turned and caught Percival and Lancelot looking at each other with an amused face. « Right, you were joking. » he said while sitting. « No. » Arthur said. « We&#x27;re just being fondly merciful, there&#x27;s no free table. And we will need you to serve us anyway. » « Ha-ha » Merlin answered with a sulky face. At that Percival just burst out laughing and Arthur and Lancelot joined him immediately. Merlin looked at them in dismay, but he couldn&#x27;t help but smile slightly when he said: « Yeah, yeah, you&#x27;re all very funny. » « I know. » Arthur answered, slapping him friendly but strongly on his back. « And be careful. If you annoy me in any way I&#x27;ll make you eat under the table, at my feet. » To that Merlin screwed his face into a sulking grimace. « I saw you. » Percival said. « So do I. » Arthur added. « That was not very respectful. » Lancelot smirked. Then he winked to Merlin and the servant smiled for real this time. Some time later the innkeeper arrived with four plates of meat and a new pitcher of beer. « Oh great, I&#x27;m starving! » Merlin exclaimed taking his fork and ready to eat. « Aren&#x27;t you tasting Arthur&#x27;s food first? » Percival asked. Merlin put his fork down while looking at the knight, bemused. « No, that&#x27;s not my job. » he said. « Yes it is. » Percival replied. « No it&#x27;s not. » Merlin said challengingly. « Actually ,it is » Arthur intervened. « Come on, taste it. » And he pushed his plate towards Merlin who were staring at him in disbelief. « Do you really want me to taste your food? » Merlin asked in suspicion. « Or is it another trick of yours? » « Surely you don&#x27;t want to see your king die a painful death in behalf of ruthless assassins and all that due to your own incompetence. » Arthur said dramatically. Merlin couldn’t help but laugh. « No one is going to poison you, Arthur. No one knows you&#x27;re here except for the four of us. » « Are you defying my orders? » Arthur looked into Merlin eyes sternly, making the servant smile fade away once more. He looked at Percival who just nodded as to encourage him to obey, and quickly. Lancelot was concentrate on his own plate just as if nothing was going on around him, a small smirk on his lips. « Alright. » Merlin said sulkilly. He took Arthur&#x27;s plate and started to cut a piece of meat. But he was stopped by Arthur who screamed: « Stop it! What are you doing? » « Tasting your food. » Merlin replied, slightly annoyed. « You&#x27;re eating in my plate. MY plate. That&#x27;s disgusting. » « But it&#x27;s you... » « Do you really expect me to eat after you touched it? Come on Merlin, I know you&#x27;re an idiot, but still! » Merlin looked at Arthur with annoyance, and when Percival started to laugh it just angered him more. « Come on Merlin, we&#x27;re just teasing you a bit! » Arthur said, laughing too. Merlin did not answer and that just seemed to make the others laugh even more. The servant looked away in dismay. « Sorry » said Lancelot earnestly, trying to stop laughing. « But if you could see your face... » « Yeah, ha-ha, we&#x27;re having fun. » Merlin mumbled grumpilly. « Just tell me why you enjoy tormenting me that much? » « Because it&#x27;s so easy with you! » Arthur replied, slapping him on the back again. « Come on, it&#x27;s fine. Eat and stop brooding. » Merlin looked at his three companions laughing and he smiled despite his slight feeling of annoyance. « By the way Merlin, my glass is empty. » Arthur said while putting some meat inside his mouth. « Right. » Merlin answered with a cheeky smile. « The pitcher&#x27;s right here under your nose. » Arthur smiled. « You really are the worst manservant I know. » he said with a smirk. « Well, thank you Sire. I appreciate the compliment. » Merlin replied with a huge smile. « Good. But my glass is still empty. » Both of them looked at each other for a while. In front of them, Lancelot and Percival watched the scene, seemingly having great fun. Finally, Merlin broke into a slight laugh and took the pitcher. « You really can&#x27;t do anything on your own, can you ? » he said while pouring beer in Arthur&#x27;s goblet. « Well, I don&#x27;t see why I should bother since you&#x27;re here. » « You would be completely lost without me. Admit it. » Merlin said staring at Arthur. « And so would you. » He added to the other two who were laughing silently. « Merlin? » Arthur called. « Sire? » « Do you remember what we said about you eating on the floor? » « I do. » « Don&#x27;t tempt me. » Arthur said firmly, looking at Merlin in the eyes. « You wouldn&#x27;t do that. » Merlin replied steadilly. « I said: don&#x27;t tempt me. » And the king returned to his plate and started eating again, a victorious smirk on his lips. Merlin smiled slightly. « You can&#x27;t win, Merlin. » Lancelot said with a laugh. « That&#x27;s what I let you all believe. » Merlin answered with a glance to Arthur. Percival smirked inside his goblet while drinking and Arthur glanced back at Merlin, pretending he hadn&#x27;t heard it. A few hours later, their meal finished long ago and a many goblets of beer swallowed, Arthur exclaimed: &quot;Argh... the pitcher’s empty!..&quot; &quot;I&#x27;ll fetch another one.&quot; Merlin answered. The servant hurried to the bar to ask for a new pitcher of beer, struggling through the crowd. When he came back, the three others were laughing out loud. « Having fun without me? » Merlin said. « Aaaaaah here you are! » Arthur exclaimed, ignoring the question. « Come one, pour me some beer! » « Yep, me too! » Percival added, handing his goblet to the servant. Rolling his eyes up, Merlin filled Arthur&#x27;s and Percival&#x27;s goblet and then went to sit down. But Lancelot&#x27;s voice stopped him. « Thank you very much, that&#x27;s very nice of you to ignore me like that! » Merlin turned around and looked at Lancelot who were staring at him with an amused smile while holding his goblet in his hand. « I was handing it to you but you just passed me by. » « Oh, excuse me. » Merlin said in confusion. « I&#x27;m sorry. » He went to fill Lancelot goblet while Arthur asked cheekily : « Are you trying to be particularly not effective tonight ? » Merlin did not answer so Arthur resumed : « Do you know that what you’ve just done is a terrible offense ? Ignoring a knight ! That requires some kind of punishment… » Merlin glanced at Arthur with annoyance but also with slight worriness. The beer was starting to have some effects on the king and only God&#x27;s knew what he would be able to do. « Arthur, come on, it’s fine. » Lancelot said to Merlin’s relief. « He was just a bit… absent- minded, that’s all. » « Hmmmm alright ! » Arthur answered. « But… » he resumed while Merlin was going back to his sit. « What I wonder it’s why he was getting distracted, hm ? » Arthur turned to Merlin who had just sat down and looked at him head to toe. Then he exclaimed, taking the pitcher from Merlin’s hand : « Maybe you should stop drinking, Mer lin ! » « I’m not the one who should stop! » Merlin replied. « You almost drank the two first pitchers on your own ! » At that, Percival giggled. « What ? » Arthur had turned to face Merlin again, his eyebrows raised and his eyes half-closed. The servant knew that face, the king was offended. He knew he shouldn’t answered anything, anything cheeky at least, but the words escaped his mouth, uncontrolled : « I’m just pointing out a truth. » Percival’s new giggle was covered by Arthur ordering : « Merlin, under the table. » « What ? » Merlin exclaimed in disbelief. « Go under that table, now. » « I’m not going under the table. » Merlin answered firmly. « I said go under the table, so you’ll go under the table ! » When Merlin saw Arthur moving he tried to get up and escape but the king were too quick and he grabbed Merlin by his neckerchief. Then Lancelot’s calm voice raised from behind them : « Now, please, stop this. You’re making fools of yourselves. » Neither Arthur nor Merlin moved for a while, then Arthur smiled and then laugh slightly, so Merlin relaxed and smiled too. « Well… » Arthur finally said. « Maybe I’ve drunk a bit too much, after all… Anyway, I’m exhausted, I’ll go to sleep. We shall all go, we have a long road tomorrow. » So they all got up and moved towards the stairs that lead to the rooms. But as Merlin made a move to follow, Arthur stopped him and said : « No, not you. You’ll check on our horses first. » « Check on the horses ? » Merlin repeated, confused. « Why would they need to be checked on, their in the stables and there’s a stableboy who… » « I said : check on the horses. » Arthur cut him short. Then Arthur yawned and stretched himself before going to the stairs. Merlin looked at him, half- dismayed, half-amused, then sighed and went to the stables. He had just made a few step inside the stables when he heard the door being opened again. He turned and smiled when he saw who was coming in. « Lancelot. » « I thought you might appreciate some help. » the knight said. « I do. » the servant answered with a smile. While walking together to the horses, Lancelot said : « Don’t took it too seriously. He doesn’t mean to hurt you, we don’t mean… » « I know. » Merlin interrupted him sweetly. « Arthur does not always know when he goes too far. » Lancelot whispered. « And the beer doesn’t help. » Merlin replied mockingly. Lancelot laughed at that. « He’ll nurse a nasty headache tomorrow morning. » « That’s only fair. » Merlin replied with a playfull grin, making Lancelot laugh again. End Notes I hope you enjoyed it!

Now trapped within his own rage, will Arthur have the courage and strength to save his best friend before its too late, or will Mordred succeed in his destiny, of killing Arthur? In a land of myth and a time of magic, the destiny of a great kingdom rests on the shoulders of a young man, his name, Merlin. As Arthur raised Excalibur, preparing for the hoard of Saxons that where crashing his way, they were all suddenly blown back with a strike of lightning as did the ones behind him as he turned. Gazing up, he saw Merlin standing tall and powerful on the cliff face, retracting his side staff from where he had just blown the enemy back. Raising his sword in high thanks, Arthur preceded into another war cry before disappearing from Merlin’s view. The Court Sorcerer of Camelot leaned heavily on his staff as he watched the battle from below, his eyes flashing here and there at unnoticed arrows or strikes of the blade that Arthur failed to notice. This battle was taking a heavy toll on him, already exhausted from heavy magic using. A sudden eerie presence evaded his thoughts as he felt the dark magic of an enemy sorcerer headed toward his king stealthily. The Druid boy Mordred. Merlin cursed his own stupidity for trying to reason with him. He had seen the fore-telling of Arthur’s death that night in the pool. The great dragon and even the druid prophet Finna warned him that he must die and not to be trusted. Arthur’s fate is Mordred. Quickly sliding down the hill, Merlin steadfastly searched for Arthur and found him crouched beside a fallen knight but didn’t see Mordred unsheathing his sword whilst approaching. “Arthur!” Merlin cried. Arthur perked at the sound of his voice and saw Merlin racing toward him. He spun around and faced Mordred who swung his blade but was blocked by Excalibur. Arthur then felt himself jolt forward as he felt the blade enter his side. Merlin was too late and with a cry of pure anguish, he sent Mordred flying as he caught Arthur in his arms. “Merlin….” Arthur whispered before falling limp in his arms. “No, Arthur, Arthur!” Merlin screamed. Grunting with the weight of the king in his arms, Merlin sat Arthur down. “You will pay for this Mordred!” he screamed to the sky, his eyes burning amber gold and soon his whole eyes where sparking deep gold fury. Thrusting his arm and palm into the air, lightning struck forth and incinerated any approaching Saxons. Then, curling in a fetal position, a blue orb, the same one used to save Arthur all those years ago, appeared around him before slowly drifting up to the cliff that he was stationed at moments ago. Whilst unknown to him, however, Arthur had been healed by the excess of magic he had released. Closing his golden eyes, Merlin felt his body go slack, floating motionless within his own rage. Arthur jolted awake from what seemed like dream. Narrowing his eyes in confusion as he saw the cloths of a tent instead of the battle grounds, he glanced around with glazed eyes. “Were am I?” he asked. “You’re in the physician’s tent, safe.” Gaius told him whilst approaching. “What happened?” he asked. “Merlin saved you but….” Gaius cut off. “But what Gaius?” Arthur asked, suddenly terrified that Merlin could be dead. Gaius sighed and pulled back the entrance. “See for yourself.” he said. Arthur swung his legs off the cot and went outside. He gasped at what he saw. In the distance, swirling thunderclouds were suspended above a huge blue sphere stationed above a cliff face. Blue wispy flames swirled inside the hue, and Arthur could just make out a silhouette of his Court Sorcerer trapped inside. “What’s happened to him?!” Arthur demanded to know. “His fury is controlling his magic causing it to spiral out of control. He thinks that your dead Arthur, that is why that you must make him see that you are indeed alive, no matter what the cost, because the same magic that he was born with his being released too quickly.” he said. “What are you saying Gaius?” Arthur asked. “Merlin is dying.” Gaius said. Determination was etched into the features of the Golden King of Camelot as he buckled his armor on that Gaius had taken off whilst examining him. Glancing up once more of what had become of his friend, he gritted his teeth in frustration as he buckled his arm piece. ‘How am I to stop Merlin?’ Arthur asked himself as he strapped Excalibur to his side. When he grabbed the reins of his horse, he noticed that Gaius was approaching. The old physician got to him and placed his hands on his shoulders. “You know that Merlin won’t be himself. Just make him realize that you’re alive, and quickly, his heart can’t take much more.” he said. “I will Gaius.” Arthur said, hugging the man that Merlin loved as a father. Arthur then swung onto his brown mare before turning to face the old, withered man again. “I promise you this Gaius, I will bring Merlin back.” Arthur said and urged the horse forward toward the blue sphere. “God speed my boy, god speed.” Gaius whispered, fearing the worst for his ward. As Arthur sped along the vast lands of Camlann, he couldn’t help but to think back to that fateful night. “ If things could have been different we could have been good friends.” Merlin said. “Yea.” he had simply said, not thinking about it at that time. Arthur furiously wiped away a salty tear that escaped. Arthur had brought Merlin on so many expeditions and quests, turning out unscathed, why would today be any different? He got to the cliff face and swung off of his horse before glancing around. Mangled and charred bodies of Saxons and knights alike lay before him that dared to get close. Setting his jaw in determination, Arthur began to climb. He reached the top and unsheathed Excalibur in case he had to use it. Slowly approaching the blue sphere, Arthur hesitated before continuing, but he cursed himself as his foot knocked over a rock, it clattering loudly to the ground. At first there was silence but all of the sudden Arthur was almost knocked off of the cliff as a gust of wind barreled into him and the blue orb shifted into a reddish color, the storm clouds overcast darkening. Arthur now struggled against winds that buffeted against him as he tried to reach his friend, Merlin’s magic acting with its own will as it tried to get rid of the approaching enemy. “ Merlin, Its Arthur! You healed me, don’t you remember!” Arthur yelled over the wind. The high king of Camelot got to the sphere and thrust his sword in, expecting it to shatter, but instead he fell through like it was made of water and then clattered to the ground. Standing, Arthur sheathed his sword and slowly made his way over to the crouched Merlin who had his hands on his head and was murmuring ‘I failed in my destiny.’ over and over. “Merlin?” Arthur asked, putting a hand on his friends shaking form. What was once cobalt blue eyes snapped opened and with one fluid motion, stood and grabbed Arthur’s throat against his own will. “How dare you come here Arthur Pendragon. Your precious sorcerer is nothing but a empty shell. Why would you die for the people that I am destroying?” Merlin said in a voice that was not his own. “No Merlin, I would die for you. You once told me that magic cannot be destroyed, YOU said that! Not this. I would die for you because you’re my brother, my best, my only friend and I couldn’t bear to lose you.” Arthur said. Confusion wept across those golden eyes and there was the sound of energy fading as Arthur watched the blue sphere disintegrate around him. Merlin’s golden eyes then faded to the pupil and when his friend blinked, they were their natural sapphire blue. “Arthur?” Merlin whispered, dropping his hand from Arthur’s neck. “It’s alright Merlin, it’s over.” Arthur said. Merlin smiled his trademark grin but then it vanished as Arthur saw Merlin lurch forward with a sharp cry of agony. “NO!” Arthur screamed as he saw an enemy Saxon behind him reloading his cross bow and noticed that Merlin’s eyes morphed back to blazing molten gold, turning and incinerating the enemy without a word. The winds shifted back up and the arrow that now protruded from Merlin’s abdomen broke away in pieces, leaving nothing but a pink scar. “Merlin, listen to me, this isn’t you. The Merlin I know wouldn’t do this. Fight it Merlin!” Arthur demanded his friend, grabbing his shoulders and bear hugging him. Everything froze. “Help me” Merlin whispered in his own voice, blinking his golden eyes once and changing to their normal color. There was then a huge explosion of magic and Arthur was ripped from the embrace, it throwing him back harshly. The king of Camelot gazed up from his landing spot. “Merlin!” he cried as he saw his friend arch gracefully to the hard packed ground before Arthur succumbed to darkness. Arthur slowly regained consciousness, glancing around at the dying fires of the war. “What happened?” he asked himself but then suddenly remembered the explosion of magic and the whispered, ‘Help me’ “Merlin.” he uttered, standing with one knee and quickly made his way over to where he last saw his friend fall. Arthur got to him but ran into an invisible barrier that Arthur saw cracking and withering away, Merlin’s magic still trying to protect its host. “He’s my friend.” Arthur said out loud. He could have sworn he felt the magic nod with agreement as the force disappeared and Arthur knelt down by his former manservant, gasping at the state of him. Merlin was deathly pale, almost gray in color, and dark shadows sagged underneath his eyes, the overload of magic having ate away at his life force. The King of Camelot cradled his Court Sorcerer in his arms before softly placing a cool hand on Merlin’s cheek. Merlin sighed softly before blinking open dull, hazy topaz blue eyes. “Arthur?” Merlin asked in barely a whisper. “That’s right Merlin, it’s me, I‘m here.” Arthur choked out, tears streaming down his cheeks. Merlin shifted and grunted in pain. “Thank you.” Merlin whispered before he closed his eyes again in a grimace, falling limp in Arthur’s arms. “Let’s get you to Gaius.” Arthur said, slowly sliding an arm under Merlin’s thin knees and shoulder blades, carrying him bridal style. As Arthur went to leave, though, a sinister voice stopped him in his tracks. “Stop were you are Arthur Pendragon.” said the voice and Arthur turned to see Mordred materialize from the smoke, his own sword twirling maliciously in his wrist as he approached. With no time to waste, Arthur glanced around for a place to set Merlin down to fight the approaching minis, having to protect his wounded friend from the traitor knight, knowing that Mordred wouldn’t hesitate in killing Merlin. Setting his friend down on a boulder that supported his back, Arthur swallowed a lump in his throat as Merlin’s head lolled to the side, unresponsive to the approaching battle before unsheathing Excalibur and standing protectively in front of his friend. Mordred dealt the first blow and the fight began. Parry after block Arthur made Mordred gain distance away from his fallen comrade, toward the edge of the cliff, but whilst unknown to both however, Merlin sighed deeply and opened his eyes as the sound of clanging steel roused him. Thinking he had gained the upper hand, Arthur raised his sword for the final blow but a noise behind him made both fighters glace up. “Merlin no! Your too weak!” Arthur cried as he saw his friend stumbling toward them, ready to fight alongside his friend. “You should have listened to your king Emry’s, for it will be your undoing.” Mordred sneered before he thrust out a hidden dagger with the momentum of dark magic in it were it pierced through Merlin’s thin side and the Court Sorcerer of Camelot was thrown back harshly to the ground. “NO!” Arthur cried, and ran Mordred through, and if that didn’t kill him, the fall did. Arthur ran over to were Merlin lay and knelt down by him before ever so gently raising his head. A pained moan escaped the latter’s lips and Merlin fluttered open moist, weak looking blue eyes. Arthur glanced down at the dagger hilt protruding from his side and with one quick tug, wrenched the dagger free. Merlin cried out in agony and grabbed Arthur’s shoulders as the golden king put pressure on the wound. “Arthur, I’m…” Merlin tried to say but all of the sudden tasted metallic liquid on his tongue as a steady stream of bright crimson appeared on his lips before traveling down his cheek. Arthur’s eye brows furrowed together as he wiped it away with his thumb. “Arthur, I’m sorry. I failed you.” Merlin whispered. “No Merlin, don’t you dare say you’re sorry! You never failed me! You showed me that magic is not pure evil and that it cannot be taken away or destroyed! You taught me that!” Arthur cried, shaking his head in denial of this happening, of Merlin fading away in his arms. Merlin grinned at this remark but it vanished as he cried out in agony as a wave of pain hit him again. “No, No! Merlin! Why did you try to save me when we both knew that you were too weak to even stand on your feet?” Arthur asked. “You know that answer Arthur.” Merlin whispered and placed a trembling hand on his cheek. Arthur was sucked back to that night. “I swear I will rescue my men, or die trying.” he said. “And I swear, I will protect you or die at your side.” Merlin said back. Arthur jolted back to present and more tears prang from his eyes, Merlin was upholding his promise. “Merlin, you idiot! Why can’t you heal yourself like you did me?!” Arthur demanded. “I can’t Arthur, I have no more strength left.” Merlin whispered. “Merlin, you self-sacrificing idiot…” Arthur whispered back. Merlin smiled softly at this but then sudden found it extremely difficult to keep his eyes open. Arthur noticed this and shook Merlin. “No, stay with me. We have to get you to Gaius.” Arthur said, going to stand, but a hand on his shoulder stopped him. “No Arthur, just, just, hold me.” Merlin whispered. Raising a trembling hand, Merlin raked it through the golden hair of the king of Camelot, savoring it. With his dying words, the Court Sorcerer of Camelot, the Kings Lion heart, made a promise. “I’m sorry I have to leave you now Arthur, and I don’t want to, but I will tell you this. I know that the gods will look after me and that one day, one day I will see you again.” Merlin whispered before letting his hand fall with a thud against the blood stained earth of Camlann. Merlin breathed in one full time, then slowly exhaled and his cobalt eyes focused on their king before fading to stone gray and slowly closing, his head lolling softly to on side. Clutching that limp, ebony dark head, Arthur touched his head to Merlin’s as if that one simple act would bring him back. Then, without another word, Arthur placed an arm under Merlin’s limp shoulders and knees before standing and slowly, ever so slowly, headed back to Camelot. Tears streamed down his cheeks as he saw the gates of the great city. Cries of the king and the court sorcerer returning reached his ears. He paid them no heed, instead he glanced once more at his friend. The sound of running feet reached deaf ears. Looking up with bloodshot eyes, he saw all of his knights racing toward him, including Gaius and Gwen. They reached him and he fell to his knees with a loud sob. “I’m so sorry Gaius.” Arthur whispered, he had failed. All through the evening, lanterns lit up the night sky as the whole in city mourned over their beloved Court Sorcerer’s death. Late in the afternoon on the second day, all of the king’s knights and most trusted friends stood before the lake of Albion, gazing out to the tower. Knee length in in dark water, Arthur placed a hand on Merlin’s pallid forehead, choking back sobs as he lifted his gaze to the sky. “Merlin…” he whispered. “In sibbe gerest” Arthur whispered, his blue eyes flashing gold as the boat full of plant wildlife from around the area and Merlin laying still inside, a magnificent red cloak covering half of him; drifted on its own slowly to the island in the center were it soon disappeared. Arthur silently watched its accent, cursing himself mentally in his mind. He watched as his familiar shadow; the moon to his sun; the lion heart to his king; his brother; his other half, faded away and Arthur knew, that someday, Merlin would uphold his promise and that he would finally, finally, get to see his best friend again. Centuries later : Bradley sighed as he strolled through the crowded streets of London on his walk. Arthur, throughout all of these decades, lived with Merlin’s immortality, watching Camelot crumble as he last descendant died whilst watching others rise. All this time waiting for Merlin to return. He had changed his name and face so many times, he couldn’t remember. Now, with the twenty first century, Arthur went simply as Bradley. He went out of the city and to the lake of Avalon, stopping briefly to gaze at the tower in the center of the isle, where he had buried Merlin. Tugging his coat tighter, Arthur continued but then stopped short when he saw an all too familiar sight in front of him skipping down stone stairs from the stranger’s home. Prominent cheek bones, dark ebony hair, overly large ears. The man wore a red flannel shirt and cashmere jacket with a blue scarf that hung loosely around his neck. The man gazed up with the same cobalt blue eyes too. It was Merlin! The man continued on his walk, but the other way. “Wait.” Arthur whispered, running after the man and grabbed his arm. The man reeled around in shock and gazed down at Arthur’s hand. “Can I help you?” he asked. Arthur’s heart shattered, Merlin didn’t remember him. “Oh no, I just thought you were someone else. I’m Bradley by the way.” Arthur said, holding out his hand. “I’m Colin.” He said, shaking hands with Arthur but as their hands touched, Colin was hit by a wave of memories, the last one being him promising Bradley that he would see him again. Again? But How? They have never met before till just now. Or had they? “Do I know you?” Colin asked. Arthur sighed and scratched the back of his head in worry. How was he to explain to Colin that he was in fact Merlin resin from the dead? “You might not know this, but you were once my great and powerful sorcerer. We had many adventures together. But one day that changed. It was the battle of Camlann, me and my knights where winning, you helping of course. But that changed when you came running, and I knew something was wrong when Mordred, the traitor knight, appeared and almost killed me. I heard you scream something about paying for this Mordred, but it was fuzzy. The next thing I know I’m waking up in the physician’s tent with Gaius telling me that your anger was controlling your magic and I had to stop it or you would die. So I rode off, going to stop you, which I did with difficulty, but you calmed down but was very weak. With everything done, we were going to go home, but that was when Mordred showed. I set you down and we fought and I was going to make the final blow but then when you woke, going to help me but I didn’t know that Mordred had a knife. You were stabbed, fatally so, and when I dispatched Mordred, I ran to your side and you told me that one day you would see me again, and here you are.” Arthur said, breathing deeply as he finished the story, expecting the answer. “You’re crazy.” Colin replied. “How could I be him of all people. A powerful sorcerer, magic doesn’t even exist.” Colin laughed. He glanced at his watch. “I have to run, it was nice meeting you Bradley, thanks for the story.” Colin said and turned to leave. “You’re a dollop head !” Arthur yelled. Colin froze. “And a prat! But most of all you’re a clot pole !” Arthur yelled again. Colin turned. “Those are my words, how do you know them?” Colin asked. “I know that your last name is Emry’s, and you always thought that was weird but the truth is that’s your true name.” Arthur said. “Now your scaring me.” Colin said, starting to leave again. “I know that you have a scar on your left side, not knowing how it got there, or that you have dreams every night about Knights of the Round Table, of Morgana, of your lost love Freya, of me.” Arthur said, approaching. “And I know this, you promised me that you would protect me or die at my side. And that you were glad to be my servant till the day you died. ” Arthur said. “I need you to remember. And I lost you once, I‘m not going to lose you again.” Arthur said, placing a hand on Colin’s. He felt another wave of memories, this time he saw himself though out his whole journey. Of him protecting Arthur on many occasions. Of Arthur becoming king. Of Morgana kidnapping him and taking his magic whilst Arthur realized that magic could be used for good and made him his court sorcerer. Of him being captured by the rugged bandit Hedrick, him also trying to take away his magic by Stealer, and a golden silhouette of him explaining to Arthur what he was. Of his kidnapping of the bandit Vincent in the cold lands of Ismere. And of his death by the hands of Mordred, him telling Arthur that he would see him again. Arthur then saw something that made him smile. Colin’s eyes somehow brightened. “Arthur?” Colin asked, astonished. “Merlin.”</span> <a href="#" class="summary-toggle">[ + ]</a></div><div class="stats"><div class="stat-item"><strong>Rating:</strong> Teen And Up Audiences</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Archive Warning:</strong> Choose Not To Use Archive Warnings</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Category:</strong> Other</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Fandom:</strong> Merlin (TV)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Character:</strong> Merlin (Merlin), Arthur Pendragon (Merlin), Mordred (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Additional Tags:</strong> Character Death, Hurt/Comfort</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Published:</strong> 2015-01-26</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Words:</strong> 3751</div></div></div><div class="work-entry"><h2 class="title"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://download.archiveofourown.org/downloads/27851374/The%20Insufferable%20Arthur.pdf?updated_at=1606965954" target="_blank">The Insufferable Arthur Pendragon</a></h2><div class="summary"><span class="summary-short">Merlin works at an aquarium.

He really just wants to do his job and feed the otters, but the boss&#x27; son, Arthur, is intent upon distracting him with shameless flirting sessions. Arthur, meanwhile, would rather spend time with his boyfriend than do his job. If it weren&#x27;t for their friends, Merlin and Arthur definitely would not be able to get through the day without catastrophe. aka Merlin pretends to find Arthur insufferable, Arthur just wants to kiss his boyfriend, and Leon, Lancelot, and Gwen definitely are not paid enough. Notes soo my friend had a dream last night that merlin and arthur worked together in an aquarium and when i asked her for details she said she didn&#x27;t really remember it that well so...i uh...wrote a fic for it....at the suggestion of another friend. i also did this instead of writing the two essays i have due tomorrow but it was definitely worth it. (if you&#x27;re thinking to yourself &quot;hmm, was it rly worth it tho??&quot; you&#x27;re right and you should say it). the stingray is named jesus because that was the first thing my friend said when i asked her for a name so we have her to thank for that. anyway this is dedicated to my lovely lovely friends mia (who&#x27;s subconscious manifested this fic by making her dream abt aquarium!au merthur last night) and tar (who is an enabler and told me she would time me while i wrote 1.5k words of fluffy aquarium!au instead of writing my essays (yes i went a bit over her proposed word count) but i mean if your friends aren&#x27;t encouraging your questionable life choices are they rly even your friends??). i love you guyss &lt;3 anYWAY, here we go! one very fluffy very flirty very cute aquarium!au coming right up :)) See the end of the work for more notes “ Mer lin!” There was a loud crash as Merlin slipped on the wet floor, dropping the bucket of fish he had been hauling from the back room to the otter sanctuary. Swearing, he attempted to stand up before the aquarium owner’s son made it around the corner, but it was to no avail. Fish, apparently, made wet floors especially slippery. “Merlin,” Arthur laughed when he rounded the corner. He was attempting a smirk, but his utter delight at catching Merlin in yet another awkward position was impossible to conceal. “What are you doing?” “What does it look like?” Merlin grumbled, pushing himself up to collect the fish. “Going to feed the otters.” “Are you?” Arthur grinned. “Because it looks like you’re feeding the floors.” “Well maybe if someone would mop the floors on a regular basis, we wouldn’t have this issue,” Merlin replied. “Mm, and who’s job would that be?” Arthur teased. Merlin paused. “Arthur—that’s your job.” At this, Arthur frowned. “Is it?” “Yes,” Merlin said, finally collecting the last of the fish and managing to pull himself to his feet without another disaster. “As an employer it’s your solemn duty to ensure a safe workplace environment and wet floors —” Merlin gestured helpfully— “certainly don’t fulfill that requirement.” “Is that so?” Arthur smiled, walking toward Merlin as he spoke. “Because I seem to remember that, as an employee, it is your solemn duty to help maintain a certain level of cleanliness in said workplace.” Arthur stopped right in front of Merlin then, who was glad for the bucket of fish between them but took an extra step backward just for good measure, only to feel his back brush against the wall. Arthur smirked, leaning an arm on the wall beside Merlin, who cast around helplessly for a clever retort. “Going somewhere?” Arthur asked. Despite the bucket between them, Arthur’s lips were tantalizingly close as he spoke. Smirking again, Arthur added, “ Mer lin.” Oh, damn him. “ Actually, yes. I am going somewhere,” Merlin grinned. He lifted the bucket to his chest, forcing Arthur to take a step back. “I’m on my way to feed the otters, remember? Or had you forgotten?” “I hadn’t forgotten,” Arthur said, and to Merlin’s annoyance, there was still the hint of a smirk in his stupid expression. “Good!” Merlin exclaimed, pushing off the wall and moving past Arthur. “Because unlike you, some of us actually have to work for our salary!” “Hey! I work for my salary!” Arthur exclaimed, moving to catch up with Merlin, who was already hurrying down the hallway. Merlin turned to walk backwards as he continued down the hall (which, given the aforementioned wet floors, was extremely ill-advised). “Do you?” he asked, quirking an eyebrow. “Then what are you doing here?” To Merlin’s delight, Arthur had to pause to think about that one. “I—I’m taking my break.” “Your break?” Merlin repeated, a smile creeping to his lips. “Yes, my break.” “So there’s someone working the cash register in the gift shop right now?” Merlin teased. “Yes,” Arthur said, clearly lying. “Leon is.” “If only we all had the benefit of being the boss’ son,” Merlin said, but this particular jab lost some of its vigor when he slipped on the still very wet floors, causing Arthur to lunge forward to keep him from falling before the poor fish and their bucket were abused any more. Needless to say, landing in Arthur’s arms was not how Merlin had planned for this particular conversation to end. Gods, was Arthur insufferable. “Luckily, though, some of them do have the benefit of being the boss’ son’s boyfriend,” Arthur said. He hadn’t put Merlin properly to his feet yet, which meant that they looked to have been frozen in some sort of comical rendition of the tango in which a rose had been replaced for a bucket of fish. Thankfully, no one was around to witness it. Or not. At that moment, the door leading off to the otter exhibit opened, and Leon stepped in. Arthur hastily put Merlin to his feet then, which Merlin was certainly not at all disappointed by. Leon, for his part, had the decency to look utterly bewildered. “Arthur!” he said first and, once Merlin was standing up straight, added, “Merlin! What are you doing?” “We’re…” Arthur began. He turned to Merlin then. “What are we doing, Merlin? You’re the one who dragged me here.” Merlin could have killed him. First he lies about having Leon take his place in the gift shop, then he blames his completely unauthorized break on me! “I told you, I’m feeding the otters,” Merlin said it with a smile, but he was cursing Arthur internally. “ Ohh, you needed help feeding the otters,” Arthur said. “Actually, I didn’t—” “It’s really quite simple, Merlin, I don’t know why you have such trouble with it,” Arthur continued over Merlin. “But I can show you again, if you really need me to.” “I really don’t,” Merlin said. Arthur laughed. “That’s alright, Merlin, no need to be embarrassed now that Leon’s here. Everyone knows you’re a bit helpless. It’s nothing to be ashamed of. Right, Leon?” “I’m not—” “Don’t worry about it, Merlin,” Leon smiled genuinely. “I’ve actually just fed the otters myself, so you don’t even need to.” “You fed the otters?” Merlin said, admittedly a little disappointed. “Yes,” Leon nodded. “I know you were supposed to next shift, but you were running a bit late so I just went ahead and did it.” “Do you hear that Merlin!” Arthur said. “You don’t even have to feed the otters now.” It took all of Merlin’s willpower not to dump the bucket of fish over Arthur’s head. “That’s great!” Merlin said. “I suppose I’ve got an early lunch break, then.” “Spectacular!” Arthur agreed. “I’ll join you.” “Actually,” Merlin said. “I’m supposed to meet Lancelot. But if you’re not doing anything, why don’t you take this—” he shoved the bucket of fish into Arthur’s unsuspecting arms. “And I’ll see you later!” “You’re—Lancelot?” was all Arthur managed before Merlin was already making his way back down the hallway. “Who’s working the gift shop?” Leon asked. Arthur sighed. *** “He’s insufferable,” Merlin told Lancelot angrily through a bite of sandwich. They were taking their lunch break near the tide pools, and the early spring air was crisp against their faces. Lancelot laughed. “What?” Merlin demanded. “Don’t laugh at my misery!” “ Your misery?” Lancelot repeated. “Merlin, I don’t mean to minimize your problems, but while your very handsome boyfriend was sequestering you in the hallway, I was having to listen to a mom tell me that the soy hot chocolate I made her son was not, in fact, soy.” “Okay, but at least you only had to deal with that woman today,” Merlin said. “I have to deal with Arthur every day.” “I think you’re failing to grasp how truly awful working as a barista in an aquarium cafe is,” Lancelot replied. “I can’t believe he told Leon I have trouble feeding the otters!” Merlin said. “The otters are my favorite! And Leon’s my supervisor, technically, so now he’ll think I can’t do my job properly.” “Have you met Leon?” Lancelot asked. “You could get away with more working for him than Arthur does working for his father.” “Yeah, well,” Merlin said, taking a small bite of his sandwich. “Don’t tell Arthur that.” “What do you mean?” “Nothing,” Merlin said, but when Lancelot continued to look at him, he sighed. “I may have told Arthur that he doesn’t have to work as hard as everyone else because he’s Uther’s son.” “Merlin!” “Well it’s true!” Merlin exclaimed. “He could get away with murder here. He has gotten away with murder here.” “Merlin, for the last time, Jesus was like, a thousand years old,” Lancelot said. “Just because Arthur happened to be working the shift when she died doesn’t mean he killed her.” “Oh really? Then how come Uther’s been having him work the gift shop for the past six months?” Merlin asked. “And she wasn’t a thousand years old, she was 10, which is perfectly young enough for a stingray. She was in the prime of her life, and he robbed her of that.” “Merlin.” “What?” “You have to apologize to him,” Lancelot said. “Why?” Merlin asked. “You know Arthur hates the fact that he works for Uther,” Lancelot said. “He said I’m incapable of feeding the otters!” “Merlin.” “Okay, fine ,” Merlin said. Then he grinned. “So tell me more about this soy hot chocolate.” “Oh, gods ,” Lancelot groaned, and he launched into a well-deserved rant of his own. *** The aquarium gift shop just before closing time had its own special place in hell, in Merlin’s opinion, which was why he thought he deserved a lot of credit for braving it rather than heading straight for his car when his shift ended. As a group of kids sprinted past him, chasing each other with what must have been every puppet in the shop, he scanned the crowded room for Arthur. He spotted him after a moment at the register, which was surprising only in that it was where Arthur was actually supposed to be. Merlin would have expected Arthur to look extremely haggard right now, given that he had a line of about fifteen last-minute shoppers and was attempting to carefully wrap up some sort of small glass sculpture while holding a conversation with a customer who Merlin suspected, from the description Lancelot had given, was the soy-hot-chocolate mom. But Arthur managed to look completely unworried, a cheerful, easy expression gracing his face. Merlin couldn’t help but pause to smile at the sight. “Merlin!” a delighted voice said from behind him, and Merlin startled. Turning, he saw Gwen, the other gift-shop employee, had come up behind him. She was holding what appeared to have once been a snowglobe, but was now several shards of glass, some glitter, and a plastic base. “Gwen!” he replied happily. “What’s that?” “Oh,” Gwen sighed, looking down at the remnants in her hands. “It used to be a snowglobe. I’ve no idea who broke it, which is just great, because it means I have no idea what kid’s parents I’m supposed to make pay for it.” She shook her head. “Anyway, what are you doing here?” Merlin glanced over at the cash register. “Oh, I was just…” Gwen smiled knowingly. “You know, we could use some help over at the register.” “Oh, I suppose I could...help out,” Merlin nodded. “Wonderful!” Gwen said. “Could you take this with you? I think I just saw a kid pocket way too many keychains.” Before he could respond, she had shoved the broken snow globe into his hands and was rushing off in the opposite direction of the register. “...wonderful evening!” Arthur was saying cheerfully as Merlin slipped behind the counter in search of a trash bin for the unlucky snow globe Gwen had bestowed upon him. “Behind you,” Merlin advised as he squeezed past Arthur, having spotted the bin on his other side. “Wha—Merlin!” Arthur said, noticing Merlin for the first time. “What are you doing here?” “Throwing away a snow globe, what does it look like I’m doing?” Merlin asked, dropping the glass shards into the trash. As he did so, however, one of the jagged edges caught his thumb, making a nasty gash along the side of it. “You broke a snowglobe?” Arthur said, somehow managing at the same time to be holding a rather in-depth conversation with the customer he was checking out about the pros and cons of impulsive gift shop purchases. How does he manage that? Merlin wondered as he hastily grabbed a tissue from the box sitting on the counter to cover his thumb. “No! Gwen asked me to get rid of it,” Merlin replied. “And also to help you.” “Help me?” “Yes, apparently you’re as hopelessly inept at managing the register as I am at feeding the otters,” Merlin replied. Arthur laughed, turning to glance at Merlin. When he caught sight of the (quickly reddening) napkin Merlin was holding over his thumb, however, he frowned. “What happened?” he asked, reaching out, but Merlin cradled his hand closer to his chest. “I may have cut myself on that snowglobe.” “You really are helpless,” Arthur said, but there was a softness in his voice. “Where’s Gwen?” “Right here,” Gwen said, as if summoned. “Our snow globe assassin strikes again. I’m just getting the broom.” “That’s gonna have to wait,” Arthur said. “Can you manage the register for a bit?” “Well, yes, but the glass—” Gwen began. “It’s fine, just take over here for a moment, yeah?” Arthur said. “Are you going to ring me up or not?” demanded the customer now at the front of the line. “Yes, sorry, of course,” Gwen said, stepping to take Arthur’s place. “Thanks Guinevere!” Arthur said over his shoulder as he guided Merlin around the counter, hand on the small of his back. “You’d better buy me a life&#x27;s supply of Lancelot&#x27;s lattes for this!” Gwen called back, but her voice was kind. “What are you doing?” Merlin asked finally as they exited the shop. “ We’re going to get you a bandaid,” Arthur said. Merlin stopped walking. “Arthur.” Arthur paused, hand still on Merlin’s back. “What?” “Did you just leave your job so you could get me a bandaid?” “Well I couldn’t have you bleeding all over the customers, could I?” “And you thought, ‘hey, rather than sending Merlin to go get a bandaid, I’ll leave my job in an extremely busy gift shop and go get one for him.” Arthur glanced around, then leaned toward Merlin to whisper, “I told you there’s benefits to being the boss’ son’s boyfriend.” “Mhm, and what if the boss discovers that his son has left the gift shop in the middle of his shift?” Arthur had to pause to think about that one too, and Merlin couldn’t help the smile that creeped onto his face. “Well, in that case, I’ll explain to him how there are benefits to being the boss’ son’s...best friend.” Merlin laughed. “Yeah, that sounds good.” “Doesn’t it?” “Uther will definitely understand.” Arthur grinned, and they continued their way toward the staffroom. “Merlin!” Gwaine, who was in the staffroom with Elyan, exclaimed when he and Arthur entered. “What are you—what’s happened to your hand?” “He was attacked by a vicious snow globe,” Arthur replied, going over to one of the cabinets and rummaging through it. “What are you two doing? Shouldn’t you be flirting with a pint of beer at this point in the night?” “We should ,” Gwaine agreed. “But we’re waiting for Merlin.” “You are?” “Well he said he needed to—” Gwaine began, but Elyan cut him off. “I just remembered I forgot to check up on the penguins,” Elyan said. “Gwaine, will you help me?” “I thought Leon was doing the penguins,” Gwaine said. “No, I actually was supposed to check on the penguins,” Elyan said. “Remember?” “But— oh!” Gwaine said, finally catching on. “Right! Of course! The penguins need...checking up on.” They exited the room rather loudly, Elyan cursing Gwaine under his breath and Gwaine doing his best to keep himself from laughing (which was not the best). When the door closed behind them, Merlin, who was leaning against the small round table that sat in the room, glanced over at Arthur, who had a box of bandaids in his hand and a question on his face. “They forgot to check up on the penguins,” Merlin said. “It seems they did,” Arthur agreed, walking over to Merlin. “I said I wanted to talk to you before we left,” Merlin explained. Arthur nodded, taking Merlin’s hand in his own and removing the napkin. “Did you now?” “I...wanted to apologize about earlier,” Merlin said as Arthur placed the bandage carefully over the cut on Merlin’s hand. “In the hallway. When I said you have it easier because you’re the boss’ son.” Arthur looked at Merlin then, a bemused smile on his face. “Okay.” “O kay?” “I mean, I’m not sure why you’re apologizing,” Arthur said. “I insulted your otter-feeding skills in front of Leon.” Merlin paused. “But...normally you hate it when people say stuff like that.” “I hate it when other people say it and mean it,” Arthur said, reaching out to brush the hair out of Merlin’s eyes. “But when you say it…” “What?” “Well, it’s kind of cute,” Arthur admitted. “It’s—what!” Merlin said. “I insulted you, how is that cute ?” Arthur, however, was currently leaning his head toward Merlin, a hand resting on the table on either side of him, and Merlin was finding it difficult to remember what he was acting so indignant over. “Do you really want me to explain it?” Arthur asked, close enough that Merlin could feel the ghost of his lips on his own. “Because I can think of a much better use of my lips right now.” “I think that’s…” Merlin began, but trailed off and couldn’t find any reason to protest when Arthur finally closed the small gap between them. Merlin smiled into the kiss, reaching up to wrap his fingers around the back of Arthur’s neck and pull him closer. “I’m going to kill Lancelot,” he murmured into Arthur’s lips as Arthur’s hands trailed from Merlin’s back to get lost in his hair. “What?” “Nothing.” End Notes i hope you enjoyed my little episode of self-indulgence! did anyone enjoy aquarium cafe barista lancelot as much as i did? because i...definitely enjoyed writing that scene WAY more than should be allowed. anyway, thank you for reading! if you liked it, leave a comment!! i love to hear from you guys :))</span> <a href="#" class="summary-toggle">[ + ]</a></div><div class="stats"><div class="stat-item"><strong>Rating:</strong> General Audiences</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Archive Warning:</strong> No Archive Warnings Apply</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Category:</strong> M/M</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Fandom:</strong> Merlin (TV)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Relationship:</strong> Merlin/Arthur Pendragon (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Character:</strong> Merlin (Merlin), Arthur Pendragon (Merlin), Lancelot (Merlin), Leon (Merlin), Gwen (Merlin), Gwaine (Merlin), Elyan (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Additional Tags:</strong> Fluff, SO MUCH FLUFF, just idiots being flirty, Established Relationship, Established Merlin/Arthur Pendragon (Merlin), Aquarium!Au, uther owns an aquarium which i personally find hilarious, lancelot is a barista in the aquarium cafe and definitely not paid enough, gwen works with arthur in the gift shop, needless to say she is also not paid nearly enough, also! i was legally obligated to have merlin work with the otters okay it just had to be that way, oh did i mention its rly fluffy, this sounds like crack but its not, like kinda? - Freeform, but not rly, just rly cute and fluffy</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Published:</strong> 2020-12-03</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Words:</strong> 2903</div></div></div><div class="work-entry"><h2 class="title"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://download.archiveofourown.org/downloads/24054274/The%20Kings%20Return%20ONESHOT.pdf?updated_at=1606113020" target="_blank">The King’s Return (ONESHOT)</a></h2><div class="summary"><span class="summary-short">After a century of waiting, pining, desperately trying to remember his lost friend, Merlin finally sees Arthur’s return.

But, as the feelings that had been buried hundreds of years ago begin to resurface, and Arthur enters an unknown and terrifying world, it will not be an easy ride. Notes Basically I couldn’t handle the series’ ending so I’m writing a oneshot. First fic so please be kind haha! This doesn’t really have much of a plot, I just wanted to write Arthur’s return. I’m gonna write another fic soon which has a proper plot! It had been the longest wait of Merlin’s life; and he had been as patient as can be expected when the other half of your soul is at the bottom of a lake and you are unable to reach him. Arthur, the once and future king, had perished at Mordred’s hands over a century earlier, and Merlin had held his friend in his arms as he heaved his last. ‘Thank you.’ Two words, symbolic beyond measure, that carried so much pain... Merlin had heard the strained whisper in his dreams every night since that day, over and over, driving him almost to madness. But, as the warlock sat at the lake’s edge as he had done every evening and every sunrise, he found himself grateful for the agony those words brought. The pain was a reminder that Arthur was real, and that the time in which he lived was too. Merlin dipped his toes into the water, feeling the smooth sheen of pebbles below the surface, clinking together as the waves lapped his ankles. Somewhere in that lake lay his truest friend and almost-lover, even though it would be hard to believe for anyone who passed. Though he now wore different clothes, spoke with more pain and grit in his voice, and the raw emotion from the event had dulled, Merlin could, in a moment, transport himself back to that day. He’d sent his best friend out into that lake on a boat, screaming and quivering with the agony of watching him float away. Closing his eyes, the warlock whispered aloud, as if Arthur could hear him. ‘Arthur...’ Merlin shook his head slightly, almost begging as he did every morning and every night. ‘I’m waiting, as I always have been. And I will do so until you return. And...’ he sighed, lying back against the grassy bank. ‘I know you will.’ The stars were especially clear that night. The lake, shielded from the world by a thick forest, blocked out the potent, omnipresent noise of the modern world, allowing for privacy and no artificial light to dim those in the sky. Merlin was glad; the roar of traffic and the sight of electricity pylons in this sacred place would remind him of the era he was in. With his feet in the water and the tickle of grass about his head, it was easy, almost too easy, to forget that any time had passed at all. He could be back on that day, when Arthur had breathed his last, and that voice came to him now. ‘I want you to always... be you.’ ‘I’m trying,’ Merlin thought to himself, fingers playing with a daisy at his side. ‘But I can’t be myself without you. I’m not ‘me’ anymore, and I may never be again.’ He knew it was time to leave. Arthur wouldn’t want him to feel the pain - though he felt it keenly - and sleep, though it brought dreams and Arthur with them, the pain he felt when he saw his face was dulled considerably. In fact, his dreams often allowed him to experience their tenderest moments once again, and this solace had kept Merlin alive. One day, as the prophecy told, Arthur was to return. Merlin was not about to die before he could be reunited with his friend. Merlin climbed into his car, starting the engine and beginning the trip back to his home. The drive allowed for separation from his reverie; from the moments at the lake, where he could think only of his friend, to the bustle of modern living, where Arthur’s ghost felt more distant. This era had technology, the internet, electricity, transport, and Merlin did wonder how Arthur would react if he saw the wild advancements he had slept through at the bottom of that lake. No, not ‘if’; Arthur would return, Merlin reassured himself. It was only a matter of when. Merlin had taken lovers over the years, unable to carry the burden of his pain on his own. But, as much as he’d tried, he could never commit. No matter if it was man or woman, no matter if they resembled his lost love or not, his thoughts always drifted back to Arthur, and how any touch, embrace, kiss, would be nothing against what his king could offer. Though the most Merlin had experienced with Arthur was a desperate hug before death conquered him, the ghostly touch had haunted him, making him resist any other touch. Nothing could compare. But, with a lover or without, Merlin had survived. He’d kept himself healthy and somewhat happy for hundreds and hundreds of years, unable to accept that Arthur was gone forever. He must be alive for his return, whenever that might be. He’d mastered all of the instruments, learnt most languages, and had enough knowledge about magic and the world to fill a thousand books. His sorcery had been honed and carefully hidden, lest he end up in a mental facility. But with no Arthur to protect, he felt useless. Merlin slept fitfully that night, kept awake by unusually horrible dreams that forced him to relive Arthur’s screams of pain, mixed with his own, creating some sort of deathly, dissonant harmony. He awoke with a start the next morning, sweeping sweat from his brow with a trembling hand and trying to slow his breathing. It wasn’t possible to reassure himself that it wasn’t real, that it was just a nightmare, because it absolutely was real and painfully so. The most he could tell himself was that the events had already happened, and that Arthur was at peace. He should’ve known that something was different that morning; the vivid dreams, his distracted driving on the way to the lake, the oddly palpable tension in the air around the lake... it was all very strange. But the strangest occurrence that morning was, as Merlin sat down at the water’s edge, sliding his feet into the calm surface as usual, the water started to bubble. The wizard frowned, the clouds above him suddenly parting, an inexplicably bright ray blinding him, sending its light into the centre of the lake. Jumping up in fright as the water around that beam started to swirl, Merlin squinted to see the whirling waves, heart pounding as he realised what was happening. It could only be one thing. Suddenly, with a huge crash of thunder, a figure burst from the swirling lake’s centre, leaping into the air and crashing back down again. Merlin knew that shade of hair anywhere; without a moment’s hesitation, not stopping to strip his clothes so they could be saved, or even to cast a water-separation charm to give him a path to his friend, he dashed into the water, calling out. ‘Arthur! Arthur!’ Merlin ran to the centre of the lake, crashing through the water, not bothering about how much noise he was making. The object of his cries was flailing about, trying to keep himself afloat, coughing and spluttering as water rushed down his throat. Upon reaching him, Merlin grasped Arthur’s arms, hauling him to his feet, the water just shallow enough that they could both stand. Words spilling incoherently from his mouth, the wizard embraced his king, grasping his sodden shirt and shaking violently from the shock and sheer joy of it all. Arthur, initially too shocked to react, still coughing up water from his sudden return, pushed the man away, holding him at arms length for a moment. He studied the face before him, before his eyes suddenly filled with ferocious tears of realisation, and the men embraced for the first time in a century, happier than they had ever been to hold each-other again. ‘I can’t believe... I can’t, I-’ Merlin stuttered, gripping his friend’s shirt as hard as he could for fear that he would disappear back under the water. ‘Me neither, Merlin,’ Arthur replied, burying his head in his friend’s shoulder. ‘Are you real? Where am I? Wha- how long have I been gone?’ They pulled away from each-other, chests heaving, bodies shaking as the water chilled them and their brains struggled to process the morning’s sudden events. Merlin replied; ‘Later, I promise... let’s get warm first.’ ‘Merlin’s beard, this water is freezing!’ Arthur chuckled, and the pair waded back to the shore, afraid to look away from each-other. - Reaching the shore, the friends were able to look at each-other properly for the first time. Arthur was little-changed, still wearing the clothes he had perished in, though they were less bloody and much wetter from his soaking in the lake. His hair was as blonde as Merlin had remembered and his shoulders as broad, though his eyes were much more bewildered and panicked than the warlock had ever seen them. Merlin, however, was certainly a different man. His chin sported stubble that had previously been kept shaven, and his hair was somewhat curlier and longer. The jacket and grey shirt on his chest were as modern as Arthur had ever seen, and the denim on his legs was too. Though, in the small details that Arthur recognised immediately, his friend was essentially the same: the small crinkles around his eyes when he smiled, the joyous mischief in his eyes slightly dimmer now after years of pining, but still present, the gentle fullness of his lips... they could recognise each-other in a moment. &#x27;Where have you been, Arthur?&#x27; Arthur glanced back at the lake, which had since calmed. &#x27;At the bottom of that, I expect. What year is it?&#x27; &#x27;2020,&#x27; Merlin replied, patting his friend on the back. &#x27;You&#x27;ve been gone for a while.&#x27; Arthur chuckled, shivering. &#x27;I certainly have, haven&#x27;t I?&#x27; Seeing that he was shaking from the cold, Merlin rushed back to his car to fetch a towel and a change of clothes, which he had stored there for as long as he could remember, in case of a situation such as this. Running back to Arthur, he wrapped the towel around him and started to rub it on his shoulders and dried his hair as best he could. &#x27;A servant&#x27;s duties are never done,&#x27; said Arthur with a smile. &#x27;I thought you&#x27;d be tired of taking care of me.&#x27; Merlin shook his head, tending to his King with the care he&#x27;d been wanting to give for a century. &#x27;Never. I&#x27;ve had a bit of a break, remember! I think I can handle this. Anyway, you&#x27;re seeing the world with fresh eyes. You want to be able to see it without shivering.&#x27; The words Merlin so desperately wanted to say prickled his tongue. I missed you. I&#x27;m glad you&#x27;re here. Where have you been all these years? Do you know how many times I&#x27;ve tried to love another but never could, because they could never compare to you? But he bit his tongue, trying not to overwhelm Arthur. The man in question started to ask all about life in the new, modern world. The idea of electricity, cars, heating, technology... it screamed &#x27;sorcery&#x27; to Arthur. Merlin had to reassure him, over and over, that this was the new version of science that had existed when Arthur was king. It was just much more advanced. Merlin knew that the only way to reassure his friend was to show him the wonders of modern technology, and for that, they had to leave the lake. &#x27;I brought clothes,&#x27; Merlin said, handing over the pile. &#x27;Are you strong enough to change?&#x27; Arthur frowned. &#x27;What&#x27;s wrong with what I&#x27;m wearing now? I think I look perfectly fine.&#x27; &#x27;You look a thousand years old, sire,&#x27; was the reply, the clothes falling into the king&#x27;s arms. &#x27;You&#x27;ll need to blend in a bit more.&#x27; Arthur unfolded the garments with trepidation. They looked relatively harmless, but were more similar to sleeping clothes, rather than anything he&#x27;d wear before the court. Ah... Arthur had to remind himself that he was no longer king. The world had changed beyond recognition, and his power had deteriorated. If he must wear these strange clothes and blend in, and if that would make Merlin happy... he looked up and saw the man looking expectantly at him... then he would do so. He&#x27;d had his taste of power and it had been his end. With the resurgence of some interesting emotions after being away from Arthur hundreds of years, Merlin turned away while Arthur changed. As the chain mail clunked to the floor, he couldn’t help the flush slowly building on his cheeks. He’d dressed Arthur many times, and had bathed him too, but this somehow felt different. The feeling was mutual; once the pair climbed into the car, Arthur trying not to tremble with fright as the engine roared to life, he found himself reaching for Merlin’s hand as fear took over. The warlock initially gasped and drew his hand sharply away, surprised by both the contact and the feelings it enhanced. But, after a moment that showed that consideration was put into the action, Merlin took the hand back off the driving wheel and took Arthur’s in his, squeezing it slightly. The King wasn’t used to feeling weak, and this could’ve made him faint. Distance certainly did make the heart grow fonder. After the journey home in alien clothes, Arthur felt rather vulnerable. The noise of the world was loud in his ears, making his head spin, and the romantic feelings that he had tried so hard to bury during his kingship were threatening to resurface. The only solace he wished for was his oldest friend, his almost lover, and he didn’t let go of the wizard’s hand until they fell asleep that night. Just before they fell asleep, and once every light had been switched off to avoid Arthur panicking, Merlin found that the emotion could be restrained no longer. ‘I missed you,’ he said, as the king lay in his bed and the wizard lay in a sleeping bag on the floor. ‘More than you can ever know. It was my destiny, my duty, to protect you, and I failed. I’ll never forgive myself.’ Arthur turned over to face his friend, secretly overjoyed that his pining was to be reciprocated. ‘You cannot blame yourself. You tried your best.’ ‘Perhaps now, I can have another chance. I can make it up to you, if you’ll let me. I can protect you again.’ Arthur smiled. ‘You are many things, Merlin, but you’re not a coward. I can protect you, too, once I figure out this... strange world, where things heat up without fire and there’s a tiny sun in your ceiling.’ The king paused, considering his next move, before inviting Merlin to sleep in the bed too. Seeing him on the floor, tossing and turning and trying to sleep soundly, was too much for him. Nervously, the boy climbed in, and Arthur tentatively welcomed him into his arms. Before they drifted off, finally re-united and holding each-other just as they did on that dreadful day, all those years ago, the long-lost lovers sealed that first day together with a kiss.</span> <a href="#" class="summary-toggle">[ + ]</a></div><div class="stats"><div class="stat-item"><strong>Rating:</strong> General Audiences</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Archive Warning:</strong> Choose Not To Use Archive Warnings</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Category:</strong> M/M</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Fandom:</strong> Merlin (TV), Merlin BBC</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Relationship:</strong> Merthur, Merlin/Arthur, Merlin/Arthur Pendragon (Merlin), Merlin &amp; Arthur Pendragon (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Character:</strong> Merlin (Merlin), Arthur Pendragon (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Additional Tags:</strong> Modern AU, Reincarnation AU, lots of fluff, I just needed to mend my heart, Arthur discovers the modern world, Merthur - Freeform, They definitely get together ok just wait, This is gonna be short I’m sorry, Oneshot</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Published:</strong> 2020-05-07</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Words:</strong> 2509</div></div></div><div class="work-entry"><h2 class="title"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://download.archiveofourown.org/downloads/5284220/The%20Letter.pdf?updated_at=1474537364" target="_blank">The Letter</a></h2><div class="summary">After an emotional night at the theatre, Arthur is more thankful than ever for Merlin.</div><div class="stats"><div class="stat-item"><strong>Rating:</strong> Teen And Up Audiences</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Archive Warning:</strong> No Archive Warnings Apply</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Category:</strong> M/M</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Fandom:</strong> Merlin (TV)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Relationship:</strong> Merlin/Arthur Pendragon (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Character:</strong> Merlin (Merlin), Arthur Pendragon (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Additional Tags:</strong> Angst, Grief/Mourning, Romance, Hurt/Comfort, Alternate Universe - Reincarnation, Alternate Universe - Modern Setting</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Series:</strong> Part 12 of Merlin and Arthur Live Again</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Collections:</strong> Camelot Drabble -- Prompt #187: Locked Out</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Published:</strong> 2015-11-25</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Words:</strong> 1089</div></div></div><div class="work-entry"><h2 class="title"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://download.archiveofourown.org/downloads/24843538/The%20Once%20and%20Future%20King.pdf?updated_at=1609907062" target="_blank">The Once and Future King (ART)</a></h2><div class="summary">When Albion&#x27;s need is greatest, Arthur will rise again.

But when, in the face of death, time shrinks dramatically and frail strength doesn&#x27;t allow you to calm the trembling of the arms around you, it&#x27;s better to express too little than nothing. - A collection of loosely connected stories focusing on Arthur and Merlin, intended to deepen the canon. I&#x27;m moving all the stories in &quot;The gold coin&quot; series here! Their updates will appear here. Notes Hello! I&#x27;ve decided to order my &#x27;The gold coin&#x27; series and put all the stories in one place. I will gradually move them here, and their updates, and news will appear here. For those who haven&#x27;t dealt with my work before, I warn you that English isn&#x27;t my strong point, so stupid mistakes may appear. Nevertheless, I hope you&#x27;ll enjoy. Out of love &quot;I believe that this cliché-sounding theory about the power of maternal love should not be underestimated. It may indeed be that Ygraine Pendragon&#x27;s wish for her son to be protected after her death was so powerful that it took human form&quot;. Elanor Wright &quot;The Shadow of the Great King&quot; Out of love Ygraine took off her shoe and touched the pleasantly damp grass with her bare foot. After a moment, she dropped the other one as well and took a few deep breaths. The touch of dew on her skin and the crisp air dampened a little the anxiety that had been tormenting her, which had been growing in her day by day until it had finally begun to overwhelm her to the point where she was unable to function normally. She didn’t mention this to Uther, or even to Gaius. They wouldn&#x27;t understand. They would have thought she was frightened by her pregnancy, that she needs medicine to calm her down. She didn&#x27;t need any medicine. It would only stun her and take away her ability to act, and Ygraine had to do something while she still had time. She knew that the price of her child&#x27;s birth would be her life; not that of some thug, a villain, a random, anonymous person, as Uther wanted to believe, but her own. She grasped this as soon as she felt she was pregnant. A mother&#x27;s life for her son&#x27;s life. It was then that an intrusive voice appeared in her head, a hissing whisper, slipping into her thoughts and poisoning them with its venom. Take some concoction and be done with it. Get rid of this parasite from your body, this monster created against nature that sucks the last breath out of you. She fought a fierce battle with this voice. In her mind, she mercilessly chopped it down with her sword and trampled it into the ground, because she loved her unborn son with her whole being. The strength of this feeling surprised her. She had never been able to imagine motherhood before, and mothers&#x27; declarations that they would do anything for their children sounded to her like just another empty platitude not to be repeated. She wanted to have a child, for her husband, for the kingdom, but not necessarily for her own sake. However, when he appeared under her heart, he unexpectedly warmed her from the inside out, almost melting her insides, it shone like the most precious treasure. And she was going to defend this treasure with all her might. Not for her husband, not for the kingdom, not for herself, but for him, so that he could live, love and be loved as she was now. She talked a lot, sang and played the lute, hoping that her boy... Arthur couldn’t hear that hideous voice. Especially the words about the parasite and the monster. Everyone thought she was in a good mood. Uther looked at her with a tender smile, grasped her hands, showered her with kisses and asked for more songs. She knew a lot of them. She wondered if her son would know them, if he would like them? She looked up into the still dark sky. There was some time left until dawn, maybe an hour. She would have time to return before Uther awoke and became alarmed by her absence. She had gone out into the garden after a particularly awful nightmare in which someone had thrown her newborn into a pit full of snakes, and she could do nothing about it. Unable to move the slightest muscle, she was stuck suspended in space, silent and unnoticed by anyone, like a... ghost. This nightmare was recurring and Ygraine was convinced that there was some symbolism in it, a warning addressed to her. There was also another dream that took her over with particular horror. Three tall, hooded figures, standing over a tank of black water, speaking in one voice about the sentence that had been passed on her son. As they finished speaking, they would dissipate into the mist, and a thunderous laughter, the frantic retching of some powerful being, would reach her. Perhaps it was the same being that tried to plant vile thoughts in her mind, called Arthur a parasite and a monster, wanted to get rid of him before he even came into the world. Today, sitting on a stone bench, in a garden she was never to see again in full bloom, Ygraine decided that she could no longer ignore what appeared to be an extra maternal sense that, since she would not be here to guard Arthur&#x27;s every step, she must provide the best possible protection for him. She had no magical abilities, but Gaius had mentioned that there were types of magic where only the power of intention mattered, that for some spells no special talent and years of practice were needed at all. From the pocket of her cloak, she took out her sigil. She clenched it in her hand, as she always did when she wanted to concentrate. Then she stood barefoot on the dew-wet grass. She didn&#x27;t know any ritual, but her heart told her that she didn&#x27;t need any. She raised her hand with the sigil, to the sky, to the twinkling stars, drew air into her lungs, silenced the whispering angry voice with her imaginary sword, pushed all fears, all unnecessary thoughts out of her mind, leaving only what was her purpose. „May Arthur be safe on his journey”, she said quietly. „May someone appear by his side who will love and guard him, as I love and as I would guard. May he be surrounded by true love and people with the sincerest hearts. May all misfortunes pass him by, and may those that cannot pass him by make him stronger and better. May he be happy and may he bring happiness to the world”. Energy, coming as if from within the earth, surged through her, from her toes to the fingers of her hands clenched into a sigil that was warm and pulsed gently. Ygraine noticed with amazement that a thin trickle of blue light flowed from between her fingers. She was overwhelmed with euphoria. She repeated her words louder, more confidently, more powerfully. The sigil burned, but it didn’t scald her skin. A trickle of light transformed into a flame. Ygraine, fascinated, brought it to her face. It was so beautiful that it hurt. She didn&#x27;t want it to disappear. This time she whispered her words directly to it, softly, as if in the ear of a loved one. Tears of happiness ran down her cheeks. The flame turned into a huge ball, which remained on her hand for a moment longer, before rising above the treetops and sailing slowly through the darkness, in a direction it only knew. When it had become barely a tiny dot, Ygraine sank back onto the bench. She was still clutching the sigil, not wanting to part with it. She had no idea what she had just done, but she felt with every, tiniest nerve that something great had happened. She had made it happen: Ygraine, Arthur&#x27;s mother. The voice can whisper to itself, maybe even roar with laughter. She is more powerful. She applied the sigil to her rounded belly. A mother&#x27;s life, for her son&#x27;s life. Arthur will be blood from her blood, bone from her bone, soul from her soul. He will be special. The thought of parting with her life evoked a nauseating fear, , , but Ygraine would probably have chosen to do so even in full knowledge of the price. Or maybe she was fully aware of the price from the beginning? Perhaps she had made the decision herself in her heart? The kingdom needs an heir to the throne, and just as men sacrifice themselves on the battlefields, so too must she not shirk her duty. She put the sigil in her pocket and set off towards the castle. It must be ensured that Arthur gets it. Later today she will talk with Gaius, who, after all, as a physician, is aware that anything can happen during childbirth and will not be surprised by the request. She wasn&#x27;t going to sully Uther&#x27;s happiness, since these were to be their last months together. She would make the most of this time, give him as much as she could, and then... And then he would have a son. Four years later, when, thanks to Uther, things were happening in Camelot that Ygraine had never dreamt of in her worst nightmares, in a small village in a neighbouring kingdom, a midwife handed a tiny boy to a woman exhausted by childbirth. „It would be better for you if that bastard didn&#x27;t start breathing”, she said, looking at her with undisguised contempt. „His name is Merlin”, the young mother replied. „And don&#x27;t you dare call him anything else”. It was supposed to be proof Chapter Summary Merlin has a rather unpleasant morning and then gets a strange command.

Gaius was out to the lower town, bringing hangover remedies to the people who had spent their New Year’s Eve in the tavern. Merlin never really celebrated New Year’s Eve with someone, not even with Gaius. But he didn’t mind, because it was his only evening off in the year, so he liked to spend it on his own. But this year was different… Notes CHARACTERS Arthur- king of Camelot Merlin- servant of king Arthur Gaius- court physician Gwen- servant of Gaius Merlin woke up from an angry scream in Gaius’ chambers, right behind his bedroom door. Arthur. “MERLIN, GET UP!”. As fast as he could he changed into some trousers and a shirt he found on the floor on his way out. Not minding putting on his neckerchief. “Yes sire, sorry, what can- “, he was cut off by Arthur, “Next time you’re late on the last day of the year, I will make sure you will spend your first day of the next year in the stocks.” He says angry, pointing his finger to Merlin, only inches from his face. “Eh- yes, sire.” Merlin said, and he walked behind Arthur on their way to the horses. On the last day of the year it was hunting day. Not just any hunting day, but a competition for the servants. All the serving people in the castle, who went hunting with the knights at least once, were invited to this hunting competition. Arthur, of course, was the leader of the hunt every year. He was the king after all. Not only Merlin had to come with Arthur. Along with a lot of other servants, Gwen was there too. It was the only day of the year where Gaius was on his own. Gwen had become Gaius servant since Arthur became king a year ago, she is a fast learner and even treated patients on her own already. Gaius is very proud of Gwen and relieved she helps him, he gets older and has less energy to be working every day of the year by himself. With Arthur in front of 27 servants, including Merlin and Gwen, they went off to the forest. As always, Merlin and Gwen shared a horse. Neither of them had feelings for each other, but they were best friends. Their friendship was strong from the first time they met but grew with each day since she became Gaius servant, because now she is around in his chambers a lot more. “Merlin you are not going to win again this year, are you?” said Gwen, teasing. “Why again?”, Merlin sounded a little bit irritating. “Well… We all know you won the last 4 years in a row.” She said giggling. Merlin ignored her, thinking about why he indeed won the last 4 years. His thoughts were broken by a “halt!” from Arthur. They were at the place where the hunting would start. Everyone got off their horses, made sure they could not walk away and gathered together in front of Arthur. “Goodluck Gwen” Merlin said smiling, “Goodluck” Gwen said with a grin, a wink followed right before she started to pay attention to Arthur. Now Merlin turned his look to Arthur too, confused about the grin and wink that Gwen had just give him. “Servants of Camelot, we’re all together again for the hunting competition of the year. Today you won’t be spending the day as a servant, each of you will be battling as warriors, as knights.” A little second of silence, “You know the rules, the bigger the animal, the more points you receive, and the amount of your hunted animals will count too. Behind me there are several tents. In those tents you can get your armour and a weapon. Choose carefully, you can’t switch after you picked one. The winner will be eating dinner at the royal table, with me.” By now all the servants, boys and girls, were all excited. Merlin gave a glance at Gwen, who was hyped up, smiling like crazy. He knows how much Gwen loves this day. She looks forward to it all year. Her father was the blacksmith of Camelot, so she learned to wield swords at a young age. “Are you all ready? Let the hunting begin!” Arthur screamed, smiling while saying the last few words of his annual speech. Gwen squeaks of excitement before walking to the first tent, the tent with weapons. Of course, Merlin thought, she always wants the best sword. Merlin also went to the weapon tent first. They were the only two who’d choose to get their weapon first. “You’re excited again, as always.” Merlin said, sounding happy. “Yes, it’s a shame we can’t go hunting more often. It’s not only fun, it also reminds me of my dad.” She looked down, the sword she had in her hand was perfect. She felt a hand on her shoulder. “Hey, it’s okay. Try to have fun okay? I know how much you look forward to this day. Enjoy it, will you?” he said softly, trying to comfort Gwen. She gave a small smile, “I will, thanks Merlin. Try not to win again.” She ginned again and with that she left the tent, others coming in to choose their weapon. Merlin was a stubborn person, the one who’d never wore armour while hunting. He never did when he was away with Arthur and the knights, so why would he have to wear it on this day? With a lance in his hand he tried to pay attention to Arthur and the other servants, but he couldn’t. Merlin was distracted and he didn’t know why. Gwen had grinned at him already twice today, even had given him a wink with a smile he couldn’t seem to understand. Suddenly there was a hand on his back, giving Merlin slight slap, “Come on Merlin, off you go.” Arthur said laughing, “You overslept and still you can’t pay attention, can you? We’ve started 10 minutes ago, you idiot.” Having that said he went off to keep an eye close on the hunters of today. Clotpole, Merlin thought, and he ran off. He knew exactly where he had to go to get a deer with big antlers, the kind of deer that made you the winner of the hunting competition. It was a small part of the forest where no one really wanted to go. Some believe it is cursed, but for Merlin was that a reason to go there. He looked around him, looking if no one was watching where he was going. He sneaked out of the area, hoping Arthur wouldn’t notice, as every year. Merlin never used his magic for this competition, he doesn’t want to cheat like that. But sneaking out to another area where he can find the winning deer? Was that even cheating? The place was behind a few large trees that looked like they had grown together over the years. Huge rocks at the side, but if you looked closely you could see the small gab between the trees and the rocks. Merlin was tiny, not as big as Arthur or the other knights so he could fit through. He left his lance and tried to go through the gab, “ouch, ahh.” Merlin rubbed his lower back, he (apparently) had grown last year, and he feared he would not be able to fit through the gab next year. But that doesn’t matter now, he was at the other side, here he had to find the deer. He searched for the place where he had hidden himself the last 4 years, but he can’t find it. “I don’t understand…” Merlin says to himself. He strolls around in confusion. Not realizing he walked all the way around the rocks, which is a long walk. The whimper of a horse pulled him out of his thoughts. “What are you doing, Merlin ?” Merlin almost jumped out of his skin, blushing and slightly smiling, not knowing what to say. He cheated, and now Arthur knows. “I eh- I was, this isn’t…. Arthur…” he felt guilty, looking down at his feet, then realizing something, “Did you follow me?” “Eh, no. I didn’t follow you. I was just…” Arthur felt his cheeks getting red. “Yes, you did follow me! Why are you spying on me?” Merlin almost screamed at Arthur. Arthur tried to get himself together, he can’t be standing here flushing red. Not in front of Merlin! He laughed, “You really are a complete idiot, aren’t you Merlin? Do you really think I didn’t know you were cheating? Ha!” he couldn’t stop laughing while Merlin was standing there, confused, “You knew…?” Merlin asked quietly. Arthur laughed again, “of course I knew! All year you’re the worst servant of Camelot, ruining hunting trips. But you expect me to believe you’re a hunting king on the last day of the year?” Arthur barely could get the last sentence out of his mouth, he was laughing so hard. All Merlin could say was “m’sorry sire…” and walked off. Now Arthur felt guilty. He looked around and realized he is close to the place where he used to sneak off to as a kid. “Merlin,” Arthur said lowly, and Merlin turned around. “I’d like to show you something, come.” His voice was calm and gentle. The kind of gentle that he doesn’t let slip in very often. Arthur had already turned around, so Merlin decided to follow him. It can be huntingday, but he is still his servant, so he must listen. “I want you to show a place nearby where we never go to on a hunting trip.” Arthur didn’t look back at Merlin while talking to him. “There is a reason we never go there.” He said. Merlin was not paying attention. He heard what Arthur had said but didn’t really care about it. Suddenly Arthur stopped and got off his horse, “We have to go left here, leave the horse.” Arthur still didn’t look at Merlin, but just walked towards the place he was talking about. He was nervous. This was the first time in years he would be completely alone with Merlin. “I used to come here as a kid. When I had to come along on a hunting trip with my dad. I usually sneaked off, to come here.” He now turned around, looking at Merlin. Merlin didn’t understand why they were here and why Arthur was telling him this. Arthur just kept going on with his story. “The reason I came here was because I used to take care of wounded animals. My dad often hit animals who ended up injured instead of dead.” He paused, looking at the hole in the ground a few feet away from him. He took 3 steps, kneeled, looking into the tiny hole, touching the edge of it. “Here used to live a rabbit family.” A tear came down and he wiped it away as fast as he could, hoping Merlin wouldn’t notice. “That was the first animal I saved from my dad. It found a partner and created his own little family.” He stood up, facing the very confused Merlin again. “When my dad found out that in this place lived several animals saved by me, he shot them all. I had to watch him doing that. It felt like I lost all my friends.” Merlin looked at him with confusion and disbelieve. “Why do you like hunting so much then?” Merlin said, insensitive and harsh. “I… I don’t know…” Arthur said, tearing up. Again hoping Merlin wouldn’t notice. And he didn’t. Without any sensitive feelings he said, “We should head back to the game Arthur.” And before Arthur had the chance to say anything, Merlin was already walking back. In the meantime, Gwen had already caught 3 rabbits. Which was very good at this time of the year. She saw Merlin walking towards the tents, Arthur on his horse behind him. Because they had all day, she decided to check on Merlin later. Not now, since Arthur was still with him. “Merlin, sit down and eat something. You’re out of the competition for this year.” Arthur said softly. Merlin hesitated, walked into the tent and before Arthur could turn around, Merlin was already standing in front of him again. “Arthur?” he paused, “if you knew that I cheated, how could I win the past 4 years?” Silence. Arthur swallowed, his cheeks flushed red, looking Merlin right in his eyes. Neither of them dared to say something, and after a minute or 2 Arthur cleared his throat and rode off. Merlin looked around, confused, and he saw Gwen looking in his direction. He turned around and walked into the tent. It was the tent where everyone could find something to drink and something to eat, but most of the servants were too shy to take something. Merlin, for once, listened to Arthur and sat down with a piece of broth in his hand. Only seconds later, Gwen walked in. “Merlin is everything alright?” she asked worried, but then remembered how Merlin and Arthur were staring at each other a few minutes ago. “I saw you two staring”, she paused, “looked… intense.” She said with a giggle. Merlin still didn’t react on her. Gwen just waited for an answer, but Merlin could only stay still. “Merlin, come on, tell me, what’s wrong?”. He finally looked at her, “I don’t know what just happened” he said slowly, head shaking a softly and blushing a bit. On that, Gwen could only laugh, “you two were staring at each other like crazy! Come on, what did he say to you? You’ve never been this quiet before!”. Merlin looked straight forward again, staring into thin air when he said, “He let me win the past 4 years while he knew I was cheating….”. Gwen stopped laughing immediately, “I knew it!” she almost screamed and jumped up. “I knew it Merlin, I’ve known you two since birth but the last 6 years you two are acting different,” Gwen was full of excitement, while Merlin was still confused, “What do you mean, acting different?” he asked. “He likes you Merlin, he likes you a lot.” Gwen had become softer in her voice, more serious too. “That’s ridiculous. Why would he like ME? First, I’m a boy, second, I’m his servant!”. Gwen laughed “Yes, and why would YOU be his servant you think? I mean, the whole castle knows you’re the worst servant of Camelot” she winked. Deep down Merlin wants to be happy, to smile, not sure why. He doesn’t like Arthur like that. But the only thing Merlin gets out is “Do people really think I’m the worst servant of Camelot?” he looks down to his feet. “Oh Merlin,” Gwen puts her arm around him, “of course they don’t. They’re just making fun of you, they just go with the king that’s all.” She hugs Merlin from his side and stands up, “I’m going to hunt for a bit more, maybe I will finally win now you’re out of the game.” She smiles and leaves the tent. Merlin stays in the tent for a while, he drinks some water and had some soup. Thinking about what happened with Arthur earlier and what Gwen said to him. ~ People outside were cheering, whistling, it woke up Merlin. He rubbed his eyes with his hands, he fell asleep on the ground while thinking about all the things that happened this morning. He stood up and walked outside to see all the servants raise their weapons, cheering at Arthur. Not seeing a winner standing next to him. He walked through the small crowd towards Gwen, “what’s this all about?” he asked in confusion. “Everyone who caught something can come over to have dinner at the royal table tonight, probably because you can’t be the winner.” She joked. Merlin just ignored her, wondering if he could also have dinner with Arthur. He had to, right? After all he was Arthurs servant, he thought. Everyone walked to the horses, Merlin and Gwen sharing the horse again. Gwen told him everything of her day, as always. The only difference now was that he wasn’t paying attention to her, he could only think about Arthur. “He likes me…” he suddenly whispered, while riding back to the castle. “What did you say?” asked Gwen. But again, Merlin didn’t pay attention to her. When they arrived at the castle again, Merlin went to Arthur. “So, eeh- I was wondering, am I- “, Arthur cut him off, “Yes.” Merlin looked at him, “you don’t even know what I was going to ask.” Now Arthur looked back at Merlin, “you were going to ask if you could eat at the royal table too. And yes, you can.” He turned away, walked up the stairs before walking into the castle. “You can, after you have done your chores.” Merlin let out a loud sigh. He had to accept it, he was desperate to have some good food from the royal kitchen. And to sit with Arthur at the dining table again. Why exactly he was thinking that, Merlin had no idea. He stood there for a while, feeling a hand on his shoulder, “oi, are you going to ignore this old man forever?”, Merlin turned around “Gaius! Sorry, I was eeh”, “You were thinking too much again, I told you before that that’s bad for you!” Gaius said, laughing a bit. “I have to go, I think.” Merlin turned around, leaving Gaius with confusion as he ran off to Arthurs chambers. He opened the door, got inside and closed it as fast as possible. Merlin leans against the closed door, trying to find his breath. “Merlin, what are you doing?” Merlin didn’t expect Arthur to be here. He flushed red, looked around, panicked, “I eh...” nothing came out. Merlin turned around and ran out as fast as he could. After doing his chores while thinking his head off, he walks to Gaius’ chambers. “Merlin, you’re late, you should be eating dinner by now!” Gaius says. Merlin ignored him, walking towards his bedroom. He picks up a cloth and washes himself, he then goes off to dinner. “Ah! Merlin! There you are.” Arthur waved at him, making clear he had to come over. “You’re sitting here tonight” and he points at the seat next to him. “I thought you weren’t coming anymore, after you ran off. What was that about?” Merlin looked at him, hundreds of thoughts running through his mind. “Nothing, it was nothing...” he says, and he starts to eat. He wondered who had got his plate filled, was it Arthur? Had Arthur just made him a plate of food? And why does he have to sit next to him? Merlin’s thoughts were acting crazy, not able to stop thinking about Arthur. Suddenly, after who knows how long, he looks up, a little bit shocked of his thoughts. Arthur doesn’t notice. “It’s great how you and Gwen are getting along together. I can see that you two became closer the past year,” Arthur doesn’t look up from his food, but he knows Merlin is listening, he somehow feels it. “We are just friends, nothing more.” Merlin answers, almost sounding bored. “You’re really looking after her when Gaius isn’t around aren’t you?” Merlin doesn’t even get the chance to answer that, “I wish I had someone like that…” Arthur glances at Merlin, flushing red. Merlin knows Arthur is nervous, but why? He can’t understand. He looks around, seeing Gwen staring at him, she grins. Merlin thinks about what she had told him today, how Arthur was sensitive about things and about how he had opened up to him. Maybe Gwen was right? He thought. Merlin’s thoughts were going crazy again. He couldn’t take it anymore. “I, I think I have to go, sorry Arthur, eh- sire” Merlin got on his feet and ran out of the room, not sure where he was heading. It was 11pm. Gaius was out, probably keeping some servants company. Gwen was at home, with some friends. The knights were in the tavern, along with a lot of other people from the lower town. Merlin was in his bedroom, sleeping, dreaming. He dreamed about today, how Gwen had grinned and winked at him, telling him that Arthur likes him. He dreamed about how he and Arthur had stared at each other, how he had invited him to sit next to him at dinner and how he had hugged him afterwards. He dreamed that Arthur had walked him to Gaius’ chambers, where they had awkwardly said goodnight and hugged again, a long hug. He dreamed about staring at him before Arthur walked away, about how bad he wanted to just lean in and ki- “No!” Merlin woke up, sitting straight up in his bed. This can’t be true, this can’t be happening, hugging Arthur? Maybe, but kiss? Never! Merlin thought. He had dreamed about Arthur. 11:30pm. Merlin was pacing in his room, thinking about what he just dreamed. Why was this happening to him? He looked outside from his small window, grabbed his brown jacket and put on his shoes. He had half an hour to get back before everyone would be celebrating. Gwen lives not far into the lower town, so he should be able to be back in time. When he arrived, he knocked on the door, Gwen opened it, “Hey Merlin, are you having a good- “she couldn’t finish her sentence. “I did something very wrong, or well, my mind did.” He said while looking slightly terrified. Gwen looked back, her friends were sitting around her small table. She looked outside, seeing no one there so she stepped outside and closed the door. “What’s wrong?” Gwen asked. Merlin was looking down but looked up when he said, “I dreamed about Arthur.” For a few seconds he thought Gwen wasn’t going to respond. “Oh my god, Merlin, what did you dream? Do you like him?” she was full of excitement. “No, god no. Of course I don’t like him!” Gwen tilted her head, looking at him with an expression that screamed ‘are you sure about that?’. Merlin hesitated but wanted to share his dream anyway. Gwen is his best friend after all. He told her everything while Gwen was smiling. “You do like him, I can see it in your eyes.” She said, Merlin staring silently at her. It got quiet, it must be almost 12am, the start of a new year. “I have to go, I don’t want to be outside when it’s 12.” And without saying goodnight he ran off, on his way to his bedroom. 11:55pm and Merlin was running as fast as he could. He must be in his room when the feast starts. He wasn’t allowed to run in the castle, but he never did as he was told. He had seen no one on his way to Gaius chambers, and when I ran up the last stairs, Merlin bumped into someone. He was staring right into the eyes of the king. “Arthur.” He could only whisper. “Merlin, I ehh, just came by to say happy new year already. I know you like to be alone at midnight on this day.” Arthur said blushing. He was standing in his pyjamas, Merlin knew that, he was his servant for 8 years already. “I should- “Merlin stopped him with the word, “stay.” Silence. Neither of them knew what was happening, and Merlin was the first one to say something again. “I dreamed about you.” He whispered, having no idea why he said that. Arthur became soft in answering, “what did you dream?”. They both never broke the staring session. “I dreamed about today, how you stared at me, let me sit with you at dinner,” He paused, “and this.” Merlin stepped forward and without thinking about what the consequences could be, he hugged Arthur tight. Arthur gave in, hugged Merlin back and it was the best hug Merlin had ever received. He even closed his eyes for these precious few seconds in Arthurs arms. They broke up the hug, looking at each other. “You should go inside, it’s almost 12.” Arthur whispered. Merlin opened the door of Gaius’ chambers. “Come, we’ll have a drink.” Merlin said. And surprisingly Arthur was okay with that. The door closed and Arthur never stopped staring at Merlin. 11:59pm. While Merlin got them something to drink, Arthur was still staring at him. Merlin put his own cup on the table, gave the other to Arthur. Then there was a loud noise, people cheering and laughing. It was midnight, it was a new year. Arthur immediately put his cup down on the table, didn’t hesitate for a second, stepped forward and kissed Merlin while cupping his head. Merlin was surprised, shocked, but not for long. He relaxed and kissed Arthur back. It did not last long, Arthur broke the kiss, blushing. Merlin was blushing too, looking away from Arthur. “Why did I win the last 4 years?” Merlin asked quietly. “Because I wanted to have dinner with you…” Arthur didn’t look at Merlin while saying that. But Merlin looked up at him, making sure he was not joking. Gwen was right, he thought, he really does like Arthur. After they kissed again, and again, and…. Again. Arthur broke the silence, “Merlin you should go to sleep, it’s late.” And by that Merlin just walked towards his bedroom. Not saying a word back. Arthur stood there, watching Merlin walk slowly to his bedroom. He touched his lip softly with his fingers, thinking about what just happened. Merlin was now in his bedroom but left the door open. So, Arthur walked over, slowly going inside. “Merlin?” his voice was still soft and quiet. “Please come here, I’m cold.” Merlin said quietly from under his bed sheet. Arthur didn’t mind thinking about that and got himself towards Merlin. “There is not much room, you know that right?” he said while getting himself in the small bed. “I know.” Merlin whispered, smiling. Arthur was lying right behind him, cuddling him. Just like in the dream. Outside there were people cheering, making fun and having drinks. There was firework and music. But Arthur had fallen asleep. And Merlin? Had never been so happy. He closed his eyes and fell asleep. Dreaming about Arthur.</span> <a href="#" class="summary-toggle">[ + ]</a></div><div class="stats"><div class="stat-item"><strong>Rating:</strong> General Audiences</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Archive Warning:</strong> Choose Not To Use Archive Warnings</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Category:</strong> M/M</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Fandom:</strong> Merlin (TV)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Relationship:</strong> Merlin/Arthur Pendragon (Merlin), Merlin &amp; Arthur Pendragon (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Character:</strong> Merlin (Merlin), Arthur Pendragon (Merlin), Gwen (Merlin), Gaius (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Additional Tags:</strong> My First Fanfic, Camelot, Shy Merlin (Merlin), Sweet Arthur Pendragon (Merlin), New Year&#x27;s Eve, First Kiss, Caring Arthur Pendragon (Merlin), Alternate Universe - Canon Divergence, Fluff</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Published:</strong> 2019-08-11</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Words:</strong> 4322</div></div></div><div class="work-entry"><h2 class="title"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://download.archiveofourown.org/downloads/24795076/Through%20The%20Looking.pdf?updated_at=1592517352" target="_blank">Through The Looking Glass</a></h2><div class="summary"><span class="summary-short">Arthur wakes up in a Camelot where he, Morgana and Leon are servants, Merlin is a knight and Gwen is a spoilt princess betrothed to the arrogant Prince Lancelot.

Arthur just has one question... WHAT IS GOING ON HERE? Originally written December 2012 Prince Arthur had been in an awful mood for the past few days and nobody was safe. Merlin had been put in the stocks for three hours, Morgana had almost her head torn off both verbally and literally, the knights had been put through excruciating training regimes, the guards had faced a level of abuse and several maids had been reduced to tears. Not even Gwen was safe from Arthur&#x27;s vile temper. As night fell over Camelot, Arthur scowled as he fell asleep. He doubted tomorrow would be a better day. Arthur slowly woke up as someone repeatedly shook his shoulder. He frowned. He was in a bad enough mood and didn&#x27;t need his idiotic servant Merlin shaking him awake like this. Arthur tried to swat Merlin away but he shook harder and a voice joined the shaking. &quot;Arthur! Arthur I know you&#x27;re awake now hurry up!&quot; &quot;Morgana, what are you doing in my room?&quot; Arthur asked opening his eyes and being blinded as Morgana threw some clothes at him. Arthur tore them off his head and glared at Morgana before becoming aware of where he was and what she was wearing. He&#x27;d fallen asleep in his chambers but now he was in one of the servant&#x27;s dormitories and Morgana was standing beside him wearing a servant&#x27;s uniform and a glare on her pretty face. &quot;You overslept you idiot! Leon had to take over for you now hurry up! I&#x27;ve got enough work to do without pushing you to do yours!&quot; Morgana snapped. &quot;What work do you do? You&#x27;re the king&#x27;s ward.&quot; Arthur retorted. Morgana sighed. &quot;Arthur just hurry up, I don&#x27;t have time for your stupid games today!&quot; &quot;What are you talking about?&quot; Arthur asked, beginning to get frustrated however before he could do anything, Leon entered the room and was also in servant&#x27;s attire. &quot;I managed to sort him out but he&#x27;s not happy and he expects you to be in his chambers now.&quot; Leon addressed Arthur without so much as a hello. &quot;Seriously what is going on? Why am I in the servants&#x27; quarters? Why are you two dressed like that and who am I supposed to be meeting?&quot; Arthur demanded. Morgana and Leon shared a look. &quot;Did you hit your head and forget everything? Do I have spell this out for you?&quot; Morgana asked. &quot;That would be helpful.&quot; Arthur snapped. &quot;We work as servants. I serve the princess, you serve her best knight, and Leon helps one of the other knights. I am not the king&#x27;s ward; all three of us are servants and that&#x27;s all we shall be. Now get out of bed and get dressed otherwise you&#x27;ll have all three of us in the stocks again!&quot; Morgana snapped, storming out of the servant&#x27;s dormitories and slamming the door behind her. &quot;Don&#x27;t mind her, she&#x27;s just stressed. Come on, he&#x27;s waiting for you.&quot; Leon said. Arthur frowned and got out of bed and dressed. What was going on around here? He was definitely not a servant and who did this mysterious best knight think he was? And who was this princess? Camelot had a prince, him! Leon took him from his room and hurried through the castle before shoving him through his own bedroom. Arthur glanced over his shoulder before staring at the chainmail- wearing figure that was glaring at him. &quot;You&#x27;ve got to be kidding me.&quot; Arthur muttered under his breath. &quot;Where have you been?&quot; Merlin snapped, walking towards him. &quot;My armour needs polished; the stables need mucked out, my boot needs cleaned and my room is a mess. Now get to work!&quot; Merlin ordered. &quot;Make me,&quot; Arthur scoffed. Merlin flung a goblet at him; hitting Arthur on the head. It turned out that that happens to really hurt! &quot;What was that for?&quot; Arthur snapped. &quot;You&#x27;ll do as your told you idiot servant or else I&#x27;ll have you thrown into the stocks. One more word and I&#x27;ll let the princess deal with you.&quot; Merlin warned. &quot;That&#x27;s it! What had gotten into everyone today? You are not a knight; you&#x27;re my idiot manservant! Morgana and Leon and I are not servants! Morgana is the king&#x27;s ward; Leon is a knight and I am the crown prince of Camelot! Therefore I suggest you all stop this stupid game or let me see this so-called princess of yours.&quot; Arthur yelled. He was in no mood for this stupid prank that they were all pulling on him. &quot;Fine, if you want to see the princess then come with me.&quot; Merlin said, walking out of the room. Arthur followed him down to the throne room. As they approached the doors of the throne room; they could hear raised voices and Leon and Morgana slid out of the door and into the corridor. &quot;Who put dung in her food this morning?&quot; Leon asked, leaning against the wall. &quot;I don&#x27;t know but at least we don&#x27;t have to put up with her much longer.&quot; Morgana replied, rubbing her arm. &quot;Did she get you?&quot; Leon asked. &quot;No, she missed. I&#x27;ll be so glad when that brat is gone.&quot; Morgana said fiercely. &quot;You do know she might bring you with her,&quot; Leon said but Morgana cut across him. &quot;If she even suggests that then I&#x27;m- Sir Merlin; forgive me I don&#x27;t see you.&quot; Morgana said dropping into a curtsey as she caught Merlin and Arthur&#x27;s eyes. From his position behind Merlin; Arthur couldn&#x27;t see the mouthed question asked by Merlin and didn&#x27;t notice the minute tilt of Leon&#x27;s head. &quot;Return to your duties. Arthur has demanded to see the princess.&quot; Merlin said as he opened the door and a voice could be heard bellowing orders. A very familiar sounding voice. Morgana shot Arthur a look before shoving him in afterwards and closing the door before her eyes betrayed her. Arthur scanned the room quickly; servants were hurriedly and silently following orders and Merlin walked up the throne room. Arthur stepped sideways and froze as he took in the figure that was slouched sideways in his father&#x27;s throne. Her feet were swinging off one side of it and she was dressed in a dress made of the finest fabrics and there was a crown on her curled head. Her normally kind face was wearing a contempt look which Arthur associated with the often-spoilt princesses who visited Camelot. &quot;Guinevere?&quot; Gwen looked up and her gaze fell on Arthur. &quot;Do I know you?&quot; she asked in a bored voice. &quot;This is my idiot servant Arthur.&quot; Merlin explained. &quot;What does he want?&quot; Gwen asked, sounding even more bored as she raised her hand and admired her nails. &quot;Apparently he thinks that he is the crown prince of Camelot.&quot; Merlin replied. Gwen arched an eyebrow as Morgana offered her a goblet. She took one sip and flung it across the room where it landed with a clang and the liquid spilled out. &quot;You idiot! I asked for wine not ale! What am I, a blacksmith&#x27;s daughter? Fetch me some wine and then get out of my sight before I have you thrown into the stocks!&quot; Gwen yelled. Morgana collected the goblet and hurried from the room. &quot;You can&#x27;t treat people like that!&quot; Arthur yelled; suddenly thinking about he had treated his own servants. &quot;I&#x27;m the princess. See this crown? That means that I can do whatever I like.&quot; Gwen retorted smugly. &quot;Now; what&#x27;s this about being the prince of Camelot?&quot; &quot;He&#x27;s an idiot; that&#x27;s all.&quot; Merlin answered. &quot;I am not an idiot!&quot; Arthur snapped; thinking about the variants of the word &#x27;idiot&#x27; that he used to describe Merlin. As Gwen and Merlin watched, Arthur slowly began running everything he had said and done over the past few days. There had been no real basis of his anger; he had just gotten himself into a bad way and took it out on everyone. The guards; the maids, the knights; Morgana, Merlin and Guinevere when none of them; not even Merlin; had done anything wrong. Remorse began to spread through Arthur&#x27;s body and he missed the look shared between Merlin and Gwen before Merlin gave the signal and the doors opened. &quot;My lady; your betrothed has arrived to see you.&quot; Leon said. Arthur turned and looked up. Betrothed? Guinevere was getting married? To whom? Arthur watched as Gwen smiled and turned so that she was sitting properly in the throne before the doors opened again to reveal a handsome dark-haired man who was dressed in chainmail. Arthur&#x27;s jaw slammed off the floor. No. Not him. ANYONE BUT HIM! &quot;You&#x27;re not supposed to be here yet. I could have been trying on my wedding dress.&quot; Gwen teased; smiling at HIM. The smile she only would have reserved for Arthur. &quot;I know but I couldn&#x27;t be apart from you any longer.&quot; Lancelot said as he walked up the hall and kissed Gwen&#x27;s hand. &quot;You&#x27;re getting married? To him?&quot; Arthur asked, walking forward. &quot;Tomorrow, not that it&#x27;s any of your business.&quot; Lancelot said, looking Arthur up and down smugly. &quot;I don&#x27;t think much of your staff Guinevere; I must say.&quot; &quot;I feel sorry for the princess; because she&#x27;s being forced to marry a pompous arrogant git like you.&quot; Arthur retorted. Seeing Lancelot looking at him like that while holding Guinevere&#x27;s hand just made Arthur&#x27;s blood boil. Lancelot looked at Arthur and at Gwen before laughing. &quot;Oh how sweet; he thinks he should marry you.&quot; Lancelot quipped as he drew his sword. &quot;Why don&#x27;t we do this the old fashioned way? A duel to the death.&quot; &quot;Lancelot, please, I&#x27;ll deal with him. Alone.&quot; Gwen said, putting a hand on Lancelot&#x27;s arm. Lancelot looked at Merlin and the room emptied except for Gwen and Arthur. The moment the door shut, Gwen had wrapped her arms around Arthur&#x27;s neck and kissed him full on the mouth. &quot;I thought that prat would never leave. I cannot believe I have to marry him.&quot; Gwen commented. Arthur backed away becoming even more confused. Gwen was acting so strange. One minute she was aloof; then she was flirting with Lancelot and now she was kissing him. However the final thing Gwen said ran through his mind. Did that mean she didn&#x27;t love Lancelot? He prayed that was she was saying. &quot;Um, then don&#x27;t?&quot; Arthur suggested. This world he was in was deranged. Gwen scoffed and shook her crowned head. &quot;That would start a war. I hate the man but my duty to Camelot comes first. I wish we could be together.&quot; Gwen said, kissing him again. This was exactly how Arthur felt whenever Uther tried to present a &#x27;suitable&#x27; bride for him. He didn&#x27;t want to marry a snobby princess or lady. He wanted to someday marry Guinevere. That thought was what made him respond to this kiss. Up until Gwen suddenly shoved him away. &quot;What do you think you&#x27;re doing, kissing me?&quot; she yelled as the doors opened and the others came back. Gwen pointed a finger at Arthur and her pretty face was contorted in anger. Lancelot and Merlin drew their swords and Arthur, confused by the situation and unarmed, could no nothing but back away. His foot suddenly slipped on the puddle caused by the goblet of wine Gwen had thrown and his last thought was on how absurd this reality was as he blacked out. &quot;He&#x27;s out cold,&quot; Leon confirmed as he studied Arthur&#x27;s unconscious form. Merlin began sniggering and Gwen ripped the crown off her head. &quot;Morgana I am so sorry,&quot; Gwen said, quickly hugging a grinning Morgana. &quot;Don&#x27;t worry about it; the look on Arthur&#x27;s face was worth it!&quot; Morgana quipped. &quot;Come on, we&#x27;ll have to move him before he wakes up.&quot; Lancelot reminded as he dragged the unconscious prince over his shoulders. He had only been making a quick stop in Camelot yesterday when Merlin found him and convinced him to play along with the revenge plan that was being plotted by Morgana, Leon, Merlin and Gwen. Once they had reached Arthur&#x27;s chambers, Lancelot bid them a farewell and left; aware that he couldn&#x27;t stay for too long. Arthur woke up to a staggering pain in his head. His vision was fuzzy but there was a dark shape above his face and a cold dampness on the back of his head. Arthur blinked and Gwen&#x27;s gentle smile came into focus. Arthur sat bolt upright; &quot;Please don&#x27;t marry Lancelot!&quot; Gwen looked confused. &quot;What?&quot; Arthur lay back on his pillows and took in his surroundings. He was back in his rooms and in his nightclothes. Gwen was wearing her normal lavender dress and loitering in the room were Sir Leon who was back in chainmail, Morgana who was wearing one of her numerous dresses and Merlin who thankfully was not in chainmail. Arthur was still confused however over what had happened. &quot;But we were servants and Merlin was a knight and you were a princess and marrying Lancelot?&quot; Arthur questioned looking at all of them. Gwen looked at the others before turning back to Arthur. &quot;Don&#x27;t take this the wrong way Arthur but we have no idea what you&#x27;re talking about.&quot; Gwen said. &quot;You must have dreamt it.&quot; &quot;Yeah, you took one serious blow to the head.&quot; Leon commented. &quot;What do you mean?&quot; Arthur asked, running his hand over the swelling over the back of his head. &quot;You sleepwalk.&quot; Morgana explained. &quot;Somehow you got past the guards but fell. I found you.&quot; Merlin added. &quot;You&#x27;ve been out cold all day.&quot; Arthur nodded and lay back on his pillows. A dream. It had only been a dream. But what a dream it had been. He realised how much of a prat he had been acting to everyone. It had certainly been an eye-opener. Content that Arthur had woken up, Gwen moved away from the bed and joined Leon and Morgana to leave Arthur to rest. &quot;Um, can you tell everyone that I&#x27;m sorry for how I acted?&quot; Arthur asked uncertainly. &quot;I mean it; I&#x27;m really sorry.&quot; &quot;Sure,&quot; Leon agreed as he, Gwen and Morgana left. &quot;Oh and Merlin, fetch me some dinner could you and some of my laundry needs done.&quot; Arthur added. Merlin cast his eyes skyward and did what he was told. However as he reached the doorway a &#x27;thank you&#x27; reached his ears. A smile crossed Merlin&#x27;s face as he leapt down the stairs and joined the others. &quot;That was brilliant, I can&#x27;t believe he thinks it was a dream!&quot; Morgana smirked; a playfully wicked gleam in her eyes. &quot;At least we know one thing; Gwen can be a spoilt brat.&quot; Merlin joked. &quot;It was called acting Sir Merlin.&quot; Gwen retorted with a grin. &quot;Do you think we made a difference?&quot; Leon asked. They looked at one another and shook their heads. Arthur wouldn&#x27;t be able to change his ways so readily but it had been great fun trying.</span> <a href="#" class="summary-toggle">[ + ]</a></div><div class="stats"><div class="stat-item"><strong>Rating:</strong> General Audiences</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Archive Warning:</strong> No Archive Warnings Apply</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Category:</strong> Gen</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Fandom:</strong> Merlin (TV)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Character:</strong> Arthur Pendragon (Merlin), Morgana (Merlin), Merlin (Merlin), Gwen (Merlin), Leon (Merlin), Lancelot (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Additional Tags:</strong> Originally Posted on FanFiction.Net</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Published:</strong> 2020-06-18</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Words:</strong> 2465</div></div></div><div class="work-entry"><h2 class="title"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://download.archiveofourown.org/downloads/8044357/To%20confirm%20or%20not%20to.pdf?updated_at=1585849789" target="_blank">To confirm, or not to confirm (there was never really any question)</a></h2><div class="summary"><span class="summary-short">Arthur Lawrence Jonathan Dubois Pendragon wants to be friends with you on Facebook.

What was Merlin supposed to do with that? Originally written for the Camelot_drabble amnesty post. The prompt was &#x27;Facebook&#x27; (originally posted May, 2013) Notes I was going through files on an old laptop and came across this, so I thought I&#x27;d repost it as I haven&#x27;t quite finished the next update of Crown &amp; Consort! Arthur Lawrence Jonathan Dubois Pendragon wants to be friends with you on Facebook. Arthur Lawrence Jonathan Dubois Pendragon 36 friends – 1476 photos – 742 wall posts – 2 groups Merlin almost spat coffee over his laptop. “What the…?” He carefully placed his mug on the kitchen table and pushed it out of harm’s way. He rubbed his eyes and looked back at the screen. Arthur Lawrence Jonathan Dubois Pendragon wants to be friends with you on Facebook. He looked around, half-expecting Gwaine to pop out from behind the fridge grinning maddeningly as he announced this was some elaborate April Fools joke that he’d chosen to execute in December in order to maintain the element of true surprise. But Gwaine was nowhere to be seen, and to be fair (not that Merlin often felt charitable towards his housemate when he was the target of his numerous jokes) this seemed too callous for Gwaine. So if it wasn’t Gwaine trying to make him look like a prat… Merlin shut his laptop and pushed it away from him to join the discarded mug. There was no reason on Earth for Arthur ‘I’m so popular I could have ten thousand friends, no, ALL of the friends, on Facebook, but I choose not to because I’m ridiculously picky’ Pendragon to contact boring old Merlin Emrys. “You’re losing it Emrys,&quot; Merlin tapped his fingers against his cheeks. “You’ve moved on from obsession from afar to hallucinating emails…great. Oh and you’re talking to yourself…” Merlin sheepishly looked around once more, just in case Gwaine had come back from his lecture early and was now laughing at Merlin’s minor meltdown. The kitchen remained otherwise empty… Merlin opened the laptop again and when all processes resumed he found himself looking at the same email again. Arthur Lawrence Jonathan Dubois Pendragon wants to be friends with you on Facebook. Arthur Lawrence Jonathan Dubois Pendragon - “Ridiculous name.” Merlin shook his head. He was not thinking about Arthur introducing himself properly, all rich tones and firm handshake and STOP IT! &#x27;wants to be friends with you&#x27; That was the phrase t hat was really getting at Merlin. They’d been in the same seminar groups eighty percent of the time for the past eighteen months (well actually it was eighty-six percent, but Merlin wasn’t supposed to be counting, was he?) and aside from startlingly regular heated debates over a piece of literature they’d never actually had a conversation. The closest they’d come to physical interaction was when Arthur, a slightly- murderous look in his eyes, had held up his copy of The Faerie Queen and looked ready to hurl it at Merlin’s head just because Merlin had dared to question his interpretation of Spenser’s characters (Arthur, of course, thought Spenser’s Arthur was perfect in every way – well he would wouldn’t he? Merlin was less convinced and had informed Arthur that he was, well…wrong.) Only the quick intervention of Richard Gaius, tutor and mediator-extraordinaire, had stopped the exchange ending in carnage (Arthur’s copy of The Faerie Queen was a hardback and it would have definitely drawn blood). Perhaps Arthur wanted to be friends on Facebook so he could taunt Merlin without witnesses. True, he could use the university email system for the same purpose, but Arthur was nothing if not stringent about maintaining his image as the perfect, intelligent, creative, athletic heir to the Pendragon shipping fortune who spent time working for international charities and probably saved small animals on a daily basis. Merlin groaned…he did not have a thing for Arthur Pendragon. Despite what Gwaine said. Or Gwen. Or Lance. Or (mortifyingly ) his mother . Merlin traced his finger over the trackpad. Confirm. Ignore. Confirm. Ignore. He should press Ignore . Definitely. Probably. Maybe? ooOOoo Friend Request Sent. “Bugger,” Arthur muttered into his cup of coffee as he looked at his laptop. “Bugger, bugger, bugger!” He slammed the cup down on the table, liquid sloshing out over the rim, and hurriedly brought up a Google search and typed Recall facebook friend request? He sighed with relief when he discovered it was possible and clicked straight through to Merlin’s page. The cursor hovered over the Cancel Request option. He was usually so stringent about adding people on this bloody thing - ignoring hundreds of friend requests on what felt like a weekly basis, and instead keeping his &#x27;friends&#x27; to a fairly paltry (comparatively, at least) thirty-six. His eyes drifted to the profile picture; Merlin was smiling that really annoying smile – the one that was never directed towards Arthur – and wearing some hideous scarf that made him look like he was about to go on some desert trek – highly unlikely due to the lack of sand and camels in Cambridge. “Bugger!” Arthur hissed again. Now he’d wasted precious seconds thinking about camels! Merlin had probably already seen the request now. Arthur supposed he could probably cancel the request anyway; Merlin wouldn’t question him on it. Probably wouldn’t say anything about it at all. And that’s where the problem lay. Arthur could not speak to Merlin Emrys in person – he’d tried. He’d made extremely pertinent points in seminar discussions and Merlin had shot him down every time. Granted, Arthur had started to make points solely to rile the other boy…but he wasn’t going to admit that aloud. And yet, for some unfathomable reason, Arthur couldn’t help but want to engage Merlin in discussion – even if it was an argument. Richard Gaius had threatened to knock their heads together on a number of occasions and it really worried Arthur that he wasn’t entirely opposed to that idea. And there we go with yet another thing he wasn’t going to admit out loud. Arthur hit refresh and his eyes bulged. Cancel Request had disappeared; only to be replaced by a button that said Friends , a little tick confirming the change. “Fuck,” Arthur breathed. He typed a message before he could talk himself out of it. Coffee? Arthur waited patiently. He absolutely did not refresh the page every three (two) seconds. When the response finally came Arthur squinted at it, not quite daring to look. As long as we don’t have to talk about books. Arthur grinned. Fine by me. Fitzbillies at twelve? He sat back and waited. Patiently.

Notes Day 17 of 100 Days Challenge. Please enjoy. Merlin loves his hometown for many reasons but the two reasons are all people seem to be aware of. Those reasons are his mother and the sunflower field at the edge of town. His Mother goes up on her tip-toes to kiss him on the check and he pulls her into a strong hug. “Thank you for coming when I asked.” His mother says into his shoulder. Merlin pulls back slightly, smiling. This is probably the last time he’ll see his mother for a while and he doesn’t want to get mushy Arthur would probably call him something. I’m going to go show Arthur the sunflower field and then we’ll be going back to Camelot.” Merlin says His mother moves away quickly only to press a bag of something into his hand. “Food for the road.” she says “Be safe. I love you.” He gives her a quick peck on the check then he’s out the door, grabbing Arthur’s hand and heading down the dusty road, “Merlin, the horses.” Arthur says in protest “Don’t worry about them. We’ll be back soon.” Merlin says Arthur gives him a skeptical look but doesn’t say anything. Merlin does say much when they enter the field of sunflowers that are brighter than Arthur’s golden hair. He just hears Arthur’s soft gasp. “Beautiful aren’t they?” “Yes, they are. Thank you for showing this to me.” “You’re welcome.” Merlin says turning around to face Arthur as they continue to walk deeper into the field. “Did you know that if two sunflowers can’t find the sun they’ll turn and face each other. “Really?” Arthur says slightly confused Merlin smiles brightly, he wants to kiss that look right off Arthur’s face, so he does. And for his effort Arthur turns as red as a tomato. And turns into a stuttering mess but takes his hand.

Arthur and Guinevere leave to visit the market for a day, leaving Merlin in charge of watching over their daughter for the day! This is a oneshot. &quot;With a golden flash of his eyes, a small butterfly appeared in his hands. It flew from his grasp and landed on the know awake princess as she stared at him. She let out a giggle of delight as it landed lightly on her nose. He smiled warmly at her, and instantly knew he would protect this tiny child with his life.&quot; Notes Just a one shot! Merlin yawned loudly, waking up a rather well rested Gaius. “Merlin, have you slept in the slightest?” the old man sighed. Merlin shook his head sheepishly, causing the older man to frown. “What? Arthur has had me polishing armour and sharpening his sword all night, not to mention scrubbing all twenty pairs of his hunting boots! Why someone needs twenty hunting boots, I will never know!” “Well, just remember to take care of yourself,” Gaius said sitting up. “I will!” Merlin replied before grabbing an apple and running out the door to wake Arthur. Merlin raced into the king’s chambers, gently shaking Arthur. He knew if he opened the curtains as usual, the queen would wake up and he knew Guinevere didn’t have to be awake for a few more minutes. Arthur didn’t budge and Merlin frowned. He looked around for a second and spotted the small form, laying in a cradle beside Guinevere. He smiled as he approached the tiny princess, who had recently lived to be three summers old. Merlin had never gotten any personal time with her, as she was always in someone else’s arms. (mainly Gwen, Arthur, or one of the knights who were surprisingly gentle with her). With a golden flash of his eyes, a small butterfly appeared in his hands. It flew from his grasp and landed on the know awake princess as she stared at him. She let out a giggle of delight as it landed lightly on her nose. He smiled warmly at her, and instantly knew he would protect this tiny child with his life. “A-hem,” he heard a familiar cough from Arthur’s side of the bed. Merlin grinned and went to help Arthur get dressed. “I saw that,” Arthur mumbled as Merlin slipped a robe around his shoulders so he could eat breakfast. Arthur had long known about Merlin’s magic since he had displayed it to Arthur and used it to heal him after the battle at Camlann. After a few months, Arthur had grown to accept it and even legalized it in Camelot. He had never mentioned Merlin becoming court sorcerer, and Merlin had a feeling that the king secretly enjoyed having Merlin close to his side, even if it was as a servant. Merlin flashed a goofy smile at the king, who playfully rolled his eyes as he tossed a grape in his mouth. Merlin frowned as he went through Arthur’s wardrobe, searching for something to dress the king in. “Try something simple, Merlin.” Arthur said. “Guinevere and I are going to shop in the market today and I’d rather remain incognito.” “Of course, sire.” Merlin replied, his voice dripping with sarcasm. “Merlin, sometimes I do wonder who your talking to.” “Of course I do! I’m talking to the biggest prat in Camelot!” “As defending champion, are you nervous?” Merlin laughed and finally pulled out a white tunic with a navy cloak for Arthur to put on and if necessary disguise himself. “Arthur, did you mean you and Gwen would both be going to the market?” “Yes. that’s what I said, you clotpole. Have you got ale in your ears?” “I was not at the tavern! And the reason I ask is that I’m curious. Who will be watching Princess Ygraine?” Merlin asked, nodding to the tiny form of the sleeping girl. Her skin was dark but she had Arthur’s blue eyes and her hair was a wavy brown that matched her skin. Gwen sat up in bed now, fully awake and hugging her daughter tightly in her arms. “Well, actually Merlin, I was hoping you could.” “My love, I’m not sure that’s a great idea…” Arthur trailed off, frowning at Merlin’s worried expression. “M’lady, is that a wise decision?” asked Merlin nervously. “Oh, don’t be like that! I was there the whole time you saved a baby from that wolf in the forest last week.” “Merlin did what?” Arthur asked, amazed. Merlin groaned, but Guinevere was not giving up. She knew how terrible Arthur could treat Merlin, and she wanted to prove that Merlin was capable of more than he imagined. “I wanted to go on a ride, and Merlin is the best protection I could have in the kingdom-” she paused to give the raven-haired boy a wink.”So I asked him to join me. We heard screaming somewhere and when we followed it, we saw a poor screaming child wrapped in a blanket with a wolf growling at it! Merlin jumped off his horse and raced toward the child and placed himself in front of the baby. Before he could defend himself, it attacked him and tore at his shoulder! Go on, Merlin. Show him!” Merlin sighed and tugged his sleeve off his shoulder, displaying a deep gash covered by his red neckerchief. Arthur gasped in horror but Gwen continued. “Then, he cast a spell and it turned into a small puppy! Merlin picked up the child, who wrapped his arms around him as if his life depended on it and Merlin carried him on foot all the way to Camelot! He was afraid of dropping the poor boy if they rode horseback.” “Was nothing, Gwen-” Merlin groaned, embarrassed. “Yes it was!” She snorted unladylike. “I would rather you over anyone else spend a day with our child! She would be safer with no one else!” Arthur nodded slowly in agreement. “Alright, but protect her with your life!” Merlin nodded wholeheartedly. “Yes, sire!” This time there was no mock in his voice, he truly meant it. Arthur gave a satisfied nod and recounted all the times Merlin had personally saved his life, and he was still alive! Arthur wrapped his arm around Gwen’s shoulders and she giggled, leaning into him as they walked from the palace. Merlin sighed as he watched them leave from the window in Arthur’s room. He glanced nervously at the child who was staring at him with wide, watery eyes. “Mama!” She screamed and a single tear shone as it glistened down her cheek. Merlin panicked, not knowing how to soothe a child. He walked over and lifted the weeping girl from her bed and he sat on the king and queen’s bed, holding her tightly in his lap. She looked up at him with wide blue eyes as his flashed gold, creating an illusion of Gwen reading a book in a chair beside the fireplace. Ygraine laughed in delight and clapped her hands with excitement, racing towards her mother. Merlin tensed. This was just an illusion, he would have to use most of his power to actually create an actual illusion you could touch. He frowned but closed his eyes in focus, and whatever he willed the illusion to do, it did. Gwen picked up her daughter with a smile and rocked her gently. “Now, Ygraine. Why don’t you go over there with Merlin? He’s very fun!” “Oo-okay mommy.” Ygraine said with a slight frown. He made the illusion stand and walk out of the room. Ygraine looked over at Merlin and a big grin plastered on her face. “Kitty!” She cried. Merlin looked at her, confused. “Kitty?” “Yes! Show me kitty!” She replied impatiently. Apple doesn’t fall far from the tree, Merlin thought dismally. Where was he supposed to find a cat? He looked down at himself with a grim expression as an idea came to him. Catulus! He whispered and slowly he felt himself shrink and shrink till he was no bigger than Ygraine’s dress. He raced to the mirror and stared at himself in surprise. He actually was a cat! He had black fur and he still kept his bright blue eyes. Ygraine screeched in delight and grabbed poor Merlin around his stomach and squeezed him so tightly that he thought he was dying. He let out a helpless mewl and tried to wriggle away, he would rather die than scratch Ygraine. At that particular moment, Arthur walked in. “Oh! Merlin, I forgot-“ he stared in shock as he quickly recognized the red neckerchief around the cat’s neck. “Merlin!” Arthur exclaimed. Quickly, Merlin turned back into himself. “I can explain!” He said, but Arthur was practically rolling with laughter. “Your form of entertainment is no business of mine,” Arthur said in hysterics. Merlin stood their impatiently with his arms crossed and rolled his eyes, waiting for Arthur to stop. He looked to Ygraine on the floor beside him and his expression quickly softened. She stood up and held her arms up to him. He smiled and gently picked her up, sitting her on his hip. Arthur laughed even harder, to Merlin’s annoyance as she climbed to his shoulders and rubbed his hair in every direction. It now stuck in every direction, but Merlin didn’t notice since he was focused on keeping her from falling. Finally, Arthur began to calm himself. “You came to tell me something?” Merlin inquired. “Oh, yes! I came to tell you we wouldn’t be back for lunch like we planned. Guinevere has packed a picnic.” Merlin nodded and Arthur left the room, still grinning widely. “Go horsey!” Ygraine cried. Merlin lifted an eyebrow and began to gallop through the room and when she pointed to the door, he sighed but continued to the hallways. He just knew what they would say seeing him act like a horse, but he would have done anything for the small child. He skipped into a trot while making neighs and horse noises. Ygraine’s shrieks Of laughter echoed through the halls and Merlin was forcing himself to stay awake, knowing he could not fall asleep and leave the princess unsupervised. He carried her on his shoulders to the kitchen where he served her lunch. She giggled in delight as he juggled five apples and tossed one in her bowel for her to eat. Again! She cried. Merlin was confused. What did she mean by again? Good eyes! She insisted. He realized she liked that his eyes turned gold when he used magic, so he caused a rose to appear in her head. She squealed with excitement and pulled it out, pluck each petal one by one. Once she was satisfied with the destroyed flower, she looked back him excitedly. He held his hand out and stuck out his pointer finger, and a small raven flew threw the window in the kitchen, perching on his outstretched fingertip. Ygraine stared in awe and reached to pet it. To Merlin’s surprise, she was extremely gentle with the creature and it flew into the palm of her tiny hand. As she stared at the small creature, Merlin looked up to see Gwaine walking towards him, crunching an apple loudly in his mouth. “Ah! Merlin! Just the warlock I was looking for!” the knight chuckled. Merlin smiled and leaned against the table behind him. “Ya’ know, I was wondering if you would like to help me pull off a, oh what would you call a small act of playful revenge?” “A prank?” “Yes! That! So, what do you say?” “Gee, Gwaine, I&#x27;d love to but I’m watching-“ Merlin and Gwaine both turned their heads to the empty seat that Princess Ygraine occupied not only moments ago. Merlin felt his heart drop to his stomach and he felt panic creeping inch by inch slowly towards his heart. He tried to breathe in and out, calmly. Gwaine looked over at the stool with an unamused expression. “Merlin, mate, I know that stool can be pretty terrifying I myself and scared of it a little, but why don’t you focus on something else, eh?&quot; “NO! Gwaine, don’t you remember? Princess Ygraine was sitting right there, I’m in charge of watching her today!” Merlin felt himself shaking and Gwaine calmly wrapped an arm around the thin man’s shoulders. “So Arthur really left you in charge of his kid? He must have been desperate! Gwaine said playfully but Merlin shot him a cold glare. “Alright, alright! We can look for her! I’ll alert Leon and Percival, I’m sure they’ll be willing to help.” Merlin nodded numbly and raced up to Arthur and Gwen’s room, searching around for the small princess. He crawled under the bed, opened cupboards, checked in chimneys, and opened every trunk in the room. He threw around laundry and looked through every pile of clothing. He threw the covers from the bed and looked under the covers and pillows and felt his world slowly come apart as he looked through each location. He moved to every room in the palace, with help from Leon, Gwaine, and Percival. He crawled through the tunnels beneath the palace and even looked out the windows, fearing she might have fallen out of one. It took a few hours until Merlin thought to look in the one room closest to Arthur’s, Morgana’s old room. No one had the heart to do much in there after she betrayed Camelot, even Merlin was hesitant to look in that direction. He swallowed his fond memories of the young woman he killed and entered the room, which was open to his surprise. He looked around the room and was excited, knowing this was the only place she could be. He peered under the bed and behind the curtains. Every motion he took was echoed with fatigue. Between not sleeping last night and using his magic all morning, he was spent. He heard a soft giggle as he looked in the wardrobe and smiled, knowing all too well where she was. &quot;Hmmmmmmm? I wonder where little Ygraine could be?&quot; He whispered and made a show of looking everywhere else in the room. Finally, he threw a dress aside and she leapt our at him, jumping into his arms. She put her hands on his cheeks and he gently placed his forehead against her, causing her to erupt in a fit of laughter. Leon, Gwaine, and Percival all raced in, their faces washed with relief. “Ah, so Uncle Merlin found her then?” Gwaine smirked. It was a joke the knights all had, trying to embarrass Merlin. They claimed he and Arthur were practically brothers, though Merlin claimed he held no such place in Arthur’s view. The knights, understanding it embarrassed him, tried desperately to get the princess to call Merlin uncle just to see Arthur’s reaction. “Uncle Merlin!” Ygraine Cried and wrapped her arms around his neck. Merlin smiled and gently drew her against his chest and carried her slowly to Morgana’s old bed. The knights left, knowing the princess was safe. “Story! Story!” She demanded. Merlin nodded in agreement and began an all too familiar tale. “Once upon a time, there lived a mean prattish prince who went by the name of Arthur.” Ygraine giggles, loving where this was going. “One day, the very handsome, kind, and innocent young warlock, Merlin, arrived in Camelot. Poor Merlin saved Arthur’s life from an evil witch and he was named Arthur’s servant! Nobody knew he was a sorcerer because it was illegal and he kept it hidden! Everyday, Merlin and Arthur went on a quest of some sort, to save their friends or defeat a foe! Arthur continued to treat Merlin terribly, and the poor servant followed his prince with undeterred loyalty! The two became very close and became more than servant and king, they became friends. Time and time again, Merlin saved Arthur’s life, and Arthur, in turn, let Merlin know he cared about him every once in a while.” “When?” Cried Ygraine. “When did he show he cared about me?” She nodded. “Well, one time we were fighting the dorocha, horrible creatures from the veil that looked like ghosts! Arthur thought he would sacrifice himself, and gave Merlin this sigil to run the kingdom if anything happened to him.” Slowly, Merlin pulled out a necklace that had a sigil on it bearing the Pendragon crest. Ygraine giggled and took it in her hands. “Would you like to see the forest?” Merlin asked. Ygraine shrieked in delight. Merlin lifted her from his lap and placed her on his shoulders as they walked through the palace. When they finally exited the citadel, Merlin and Ygraine were in the forest in no time. Ygraine happily rode on his shoulders and Merlin reached up to the trees and handed her apples as he walked whistling a cheerful tune. Ygraine didn’t know it, but she closed her eyes and swayed happily. Merlin used some tricks to summon forth the timidest animals to them and took Ygraine down so she could pet rabbits, ferrets, foxes, and even sat on the back of a deer for a while. When she was done, she crawled back on Merlin’s shoulder and he stopped for a drink. When he was closing his eyes, Ygraine darted her small hand down and splashed him in the face. He gasped in surprise as it soaked his clothing, but simply smirked and tossed her in the air very high. She screamed in horror and as she fell closer to the ground, he used his magic to slow her descent and caught her in his arms. She instantly pulled at his hair as he placed her back in his shoulders so he wouldn’t do it again. Merlin and Ygraine began to head back when three men dressed completely in black, raced towards them with raised swords. Merlin snarled and set Ygraine on the ground, and stood in front of her protectively. The bandits all raced at him, and with a snap, they flew harshly into trees and one unlucky fellow hit a stone. To Merlin’s surprise, there was another one he missed. The bandit swiped his sword across Merlin’s chest, and he gasped, trying not to fall. Merlin shouted a spell and the bandit went flying backward. As he soars through the air away from the warlock and the princess, his sword ran along Merlin’s cheek, causing a stream of blood flowing down his face. All four bandits lay either dead or unconscious, and Merlin felt himself slowly sinking to the ground. Using most of the energy he had left, he drew his hand to his chest and muttered a small spell to close most of the wound, but he didn’t have the strength to heal it completely. He leaned against the tree Ygraine sat against with a shocked, pale expression and he felt like weeping, knowing what a child her age had just witnessed. He felt small tears escaping his eyes and he secretly hoped they would drain the blood dripping from his face. Ygraine meekly stood up and held her outstretched arms to him. He took her in his arms and sat her against his hips so she would get blood on her dress from his hip. She pointed to his neckerchief and he handed it to her, then she wiped his face of gently and placed it against his chest to stench the blood flow. He smiled at the small girl, surprised at her bravery. He mustered up what strength he had left and carried her to the castle. When he reached the guards, he ordered them to send Gaius to King Arthur’s chambers and they obliged, seeing his state. Merlin carried Ygraine to her bed and he sat on Arthur’s bed, watching her closely. Gaius walked in and instantly yelled. “Merlin! How idiotic can you get? You don’t expect me to believe you were stupid enough to go in the woods with Ygraine?” Merlin sighed and lifted his shirt, showing Gaius his chest. Gaius rolled his eyes but Merlin didn’t miss the worry on the old man’s face. Gaius began to wrap it in bandages and Merlin sighed laying back slowly. Without thinking he slowly closed his eyes. He absently felt Ygraine crawl on his chest and wrapped one arm around her as they both drifted off. Gwaine walked into The royals chambers to check on Merlin and a warm smile lit his expression when he saw the tiny princess curled into a ball on Merlin’s chest, and he had an arm laying on her back. Gwaine heard the horns announcing Arthur and Gwen’s arrival, so he raced down and pushed them urgently to their room. Arthur was shocked to see Merlin laying on his bed, but saw the bags around his eyes and said nothing. Gwen laughed with delight seeing her closest friend and her daughter so close. Arthur wrapped Guinevere in his arms and whispered softly, let’s not wake them yet. He felt a small tug on his trousers and to his shock saw Ygraine staring at him. “Dadda! Don’t wake Uncle Merlin!” She insisted and the shock on Arthur’s face had Gwaine on the ground, rolling with laughter, causing a confused Merlin to sit up and stare at them with a comical expression while rubbing his eyes. Over the years, Merlin and Ygraine were inseparable. He loved her so dearly that often they would have sleepovers in Merlin’s chambers and Ygraine would drag her mattress to his room. When she had nightmares, he sat in a chair by her bed and hummed all night. When she was an adolescent, she went on horseback rides with him every day and went to him every hour for council. When her parents scolded her, she went on strike and stayed with Merlin in his chambers on a spare bed he had permanently moved in there for her. She read every book he had and enjoyed chatting mindlessly with him while they created potions together. At Ygraine’s fifteenth birthday, Merlin was named Cout Sorcerer and she couldn’t have been happier. With his new duty, he searched for dragon eggs and when they were of age, he and Ygraine rode them together. Rumors quickly spread that she was as much Merlin’s child as she was Arthur and Gwen’s! Although Merlin was extremely protective of her, she was every ounce as protective as him, and the sad day Gaius died she quickly filled his role of scolding Merlin endlessly. There was nothing Merlin wouldn’t do for Ygraine, and nothing Ygraine wouldn’t do for Merlin. Often, Arthur got extremely jealous of Merlin, convinced that she loved Merlin more than him, and if she was furious she would say so to his face, but he trusted Merlin to take care of her and she always came back to her father in the end.

The homophobia is mostly implied, nothing outright. &quot;Merlin?&quot; Arthur hissed out, as he leaned into a crevice in the wall. &quot;Arthur! Finally.&quot; The dark haired boy popped out from his hiding place, bringing a relieved sigh from Arthur. &quot;I was held up. My father.&quot; Merlin nodded in understanding and the two slipped into the dark. Minutes later Merlin was pressed back against the stone wall, hips held down by Arthur&#x27;s hand. The blonde boy nipped gently at Merlin&#x27;s neck, murmuring into his ear. &quot;Missed you.&quot; Merlin sighed into the touch of Arthur&#x27;s lips, and the blonde brought his head up, bringing his lips to Merlin&#x27;s. The two pressed together, Merlin tugging his lover close. Several minutes later, the two broke apart, chests heaving and lips swollen. Merlin grinned up at Arthur, who returned the look. Arthur took Merlin by the hand and the two slipped quietly up to Merlin&#x27;s room. As soon as the door shut Arthur was pulling Merlin close again, seeking any touch. The blonde pushed Merlin back slightly, falling onto the bed. Merlin laughed, then clapped a hand over his mouth, his eyes twinkling. Arthur snorted, but the two quickly became involved in each other&#x27;s touch once again. Arthur lay on top of Merlin, cradling the dark haired boy&#x27;s face in his hand, and kissing the life out of him. Merlin wrapped his arms around Arthur, pulling him closer. Arthur slid one hand away from Merlin&#x27;s face, and slowly slid it under the fabric of Merlin&#x27;s shirt, his hand resting on Merlin&#x27;s stomach, a gentle warmth. Arthur&#x27;s lips traveled down Merlin&#x27;s neck, the smaller boy moaning quietly and the sensation. Arthur rested his other hand on Merlin&#x27;s chest, and then whispered out a rough, &quot;Off.&quot; Merlin sat up, tugging the shirt over his shoulders, before laying back down, a blush spreading down his neck to his chest. Arthur smirked at him, then re-connected their lips briefly, his mouth traveling slowly across Merlin&#x27;s torso, teasing his nipples gently, slowly, before traveling down further. He teased Merlin a bit, tracing patterns across Merlin&#x27;s stomach, knowing he was ticklish. &quot;Arthur!&quot; Merlin hissed, his stomach tensing in protest. Merlin shoved at Arthur&#x27;s head lightly, teasingly, but Arthur got off Merlin entirely. &quot;Oh, you want me off then?&quot; He smirked, and Merlin groaned. &quot;No, I don&#x27;t.&quot; &quot;You sure? You really seemed like you didn&#x27;t there.&quot; His tone was teasing, and Merlin replied with, &quot;I don&#x27;t want you tickling me, but I want you...there...&quot; &quot;Where?&quot; &quot;/There/. Arthur, you know what I mean!&quot; &quot;I wanna hear you say it.&quot; Arthur said, murmuring into his ear, as he lowered his body back down onto Merlin&#x27;s. Merlin rolled his eyes, but muttered out, &quot;I want you on my cock.&quot; Arthur laughed, low in his throat. &quot;Perfect.&quot; The blonde slid back down to Merlin&#x27;s stomach, and after pressing a kiss to his belly button and getting a threatening glare from Merlin he went lower. Arthur grabbed at Merlin&#x27;s trousers, sliding them off his legs. His head went down, and Merlin&#x27;s back arched. ------- Sometime later Arthur lay on Merlins chest, both boys sweaty, their bare skin rosy from their activities. They lay in silence, snuggled into each other, their legs entwined, candlelight flickering on them. Merlin slid his hand onto Arthur&#x27;s cheek, tilting the blonde&#x27;s head so their eyes met. &quot;Hmm?&quot; Arthur mumbled sleepily. &quot;I love you.&quot; Arthur smiled, his eyes close to shutting. &quot;Love you too Mer.&quot; Suddenly, the door opened, showing the shocked face of Gaius. &quot;Excuse me?!&quot; The two jumped, Merlin trying to stutter out an excuse. &quot;Um, uh, I was jus- I mean, we were just-&quot; Arthur interuppted. &quot;We were just hot.&quot; Merlin glared at him when Gaius glanced away, to which Arthur raised his eyebrows, with an expression saying, &#x27;what else could I say.&#x27; &quot;You were hot then.&quot; Gaius said, clearly unbelieving, &quot;Why were you here in the first place then your Majesty? In Merlin&#x27;s bed of all places.&quot; &quot;Well, um,&quot; Now it was Arthur&#x27;s turn to sputter. &quot;He had a disagreement with his father, and needed some place to cool off. We got tired.&quot; Merlin offered. Gaius raised an eyebrow, and then sighed. &quot;I&#x27;m sure you could return to your room without confrontation from your father now my lord.&quot; &quot;Certainly.&quot; Arthur glanced at the door, knowing he was still undressed. &quot;I&#x27;ll leave in a moment.&quot; Arthur nodded at Gaius, who sighed and left the room, but not before giving Merlin a Look. As soon as the door shut, Arthur scrambled for his clothes, as did Merlin. &quot;Hey,&quot; Arthur said, catching sight of Merlin&#x27;s fearful face. &quot;We&#x27;ll be okay. I can see to that.&quot; Merlin nodded, and Arthur brushed his cheek softly with his hand, then leaned in for a quick, very quick kiss. The two went downstairs, and after bidding Gaius goodnight, Arthur was on his way. Merlin avoided the old man&#x27;s eyes, and tried to walk quietly to his room, but Gaius stopped him. &quot;So. Are you going to explain?&quot; &quot;I thought we already had.&quot; Gaius sighed, and sat down. &quot;Merlin. I&#x27;m not stupid. Besides the fact that both of your clothes were strewn about the floor and your bodies are both strewn with kissbruises, you are both terrible, terrible, liars.&quot; Merlin let out a gust of air, and sat down, his face in his hand. After a moment he raised his head, meeting Gaius&#x27;s eyes. &quot;I&#x27;m sorry.&quot; &quot;Do you love him?&quot; &quot;What?&quot; &quot;I asked you if you love him. Do you?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; Merlin whispered, eyes on the floor now. &quot;And he you?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;How long?&quot; &quot;Less than a year. Eight months, in two weeks.&quot; &quot;Well. Invite him here tommorow, I just talk with him.&quot; Merlin looked up, wary. &quot;Why?&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m your guardian, I have to approve of him. He may be the kings son, but that doesn&#x27;t mean he gets to hurt my ward.&quot; Gaius looked down at Merlin kindly, whose face clearly showed his shock. &quot;You aren&#x27;t going to kick me out? Or report us?&quot; &quot;No, I&#x27;m not Merlin. I care for you, if Arthur is who makes you happy then so be it. Doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m going to go easy on him tommorow though.&quot; He said with a wink. &quot;Thank you.&quot; Merlin said, still somewhat dazed. &quot;Of course.&quot;</span> <a href="#" class="summary-toggle">[ + ]</a></div><div class="stats"><div class="stat-item"><strong>Rating:</strong> Teen And Up Audiences</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Archive Warning:</strong> No Archive Warnings Apply</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Category:</strong> M/M</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Fandom:</strong> Merlin (TV)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Relationship:</strong> Merlin/Arthur Pendragon (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Character:</strong> Merlin (Merlin), Arthur Pendragon (Merlin), Gaius (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Additional Tags:</strong> Canon Era, Secret Relationship, Period-Typical Homophobia, Protective Gaius (Merlin), Gaius is So Done (Merlin), Caught, Boys Kissing, almost smut but not quite, Protective Arthur Pendragon (Merlin), Bad Lying, Top Arthur Pendragon (Merlin), Bottom Merlin (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Series:</strong> Part 2 of the volume of merlin</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Published:</strong> 2020-10-22</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Words:</strong> 1034</div></div></div><div class="work-entry"><h2 class="title"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://download.archiveofourown.org/downloads/27717881/Well%20Take%20Our%20Leave%20and.pdf?updated_at=1610332851" target="_blank">We’ll Take Our Leave and Go (edited)</a></h2><div class="summary"><span class="summary-short">Captain Jack Sparrow acquires a map detailing all the last known dragon eggs.

He arrives in Camelot searching for his brother, Balinor. He finds Merlin. Merlin travels on the Black Pearl to find his heritage and to bring Albion closer. Arthur, King of Camelot, has to rule without Merlin at his side. He discovers more than he wanted to. (Teen for Language) Notes See the end of the work for notes Madness, It Runs in the Family “The sky’s gone dark. I wonder if it’ll rain today” Merlin glanced out the palace window, looking upon the village square. “Merlin spend less time worrying about the weather and more time polishing my boots. You’ll destroy them at this rate” Arthur teased. “And what do you know about polishing? Sire.” He added as an afterthought with a grin. “Merlin?” “Shut up?” “Ah there might be a brain in there after all” Arthur ruffled Merlins hair, “ Let&#x27;s go see if we can practice some mace work before the weather turns” “But if we get caught it’ll take me forever to properly clean your armour!” Merlin complained. Arthur gave him a knowing look. Merlin groaned, knowing that it was the point. He begrudgingly followed his King. ~&lt;&gt;~ “Why couldn’t Balinor live somewhere warmer?” Captain Jack Sparrow said to himself, closing his compass. “You’d think he’d like somewhere nice and warm to live with that judgemental lizard of his. But no!” He laughed, no one else found it funny. He stared owlishly at his crew. “What are you waiting for? Hoist the sails!” He called before doing a quick spin to the captain&#x27;s chambers. He glanced at the large map on the wall. It was an ageing piece, large in scale and for how much it covered. Jack could almost bet there was the whole world there right up to the end. And on it were fifty or so x marks. One right on top of where Camelot lay. Where his brother lived. ~&lt;&gt;~ Unbeknownst to Merlin, the Black Pearl had docked earlier that night. About half a days ride from Camelot’s citadel. Unbeknownst to Merlin, his life was about to change and his family just a little bit bigger. ~&lt;&gt;~ Merlin was muttering to himself about how many ways he could “inconvenience” the king when someone pushed right into him, making him drop Arthur&#x27;s wet, armour. “Oi! Watch it!” The man said and barreled forward. He wore strange clothing and had a strange accent, but Merlin paid little mind to it since Camelot was known for housing many travellers. He thought of the man who pushed into him. He wondered what he might’ve seen. Merlin was never one for travel, he liked to stay in one place, create roots and bonds. Camelot was his home. He couldn’t help but be interested in the stories though. The knowledge one holds after such a journey. “Prat.” Merlin dropped down to collect the fallen armguards. They were only getting worse the longer it took him to get to the castle. Or maybe Merlin was just over analyzing a man who had gone completely barmy. He sighed and headed into the castle. Meanwhile Jack was pulling out his compass every few seconds. Balinor had to be here. The compass was never wrong. But why would he choose to live in Camelot of all places? His brother hated the hustle and bustle of large kingdoms. He preferred living remotely so he could take his dragons out flying whenever he wanted. Perhaps he was there for a trip? That would explain the compass. But it wouldn’t explain why he hadn’t seen his brother anywhere. He stops a quiet looking maid with a tap on a shoulder and his best charming smile (which was not very charming at all) “excuse me miss-“ “Guinevere” She was clearly taken back by the pirate and very confused. Jack didn’t care. “I’m looking for a man named Balinor.” She thought for a moment “ I’m sorry I don’t think I can help you. I don’t anyone by that name.” She started to walk away but Jack held out his arm. Her eyes widened when she saw the pirate brand on his arm but he quickly covered it up. “Tall, blue eyes, Black hair? Awkward looking fella with a knack for animals?” He tried. Guinevere looked shocked for a second and then thoughtful. Ah ha! She did know him! “ you should see Gaius, the court physician, he might be there” Jack frowned. If Balinor was hurt then he couldn’t help him and that could set him back months that he didn’t have. The sky rumbled and the once light shower turned into a storm. Gwen apologized before running into the castle but it was unheard in the rain. Jack, who was used to this kind of weather at sea, talked to himself for a few minutes before trying to find said physicians chambers. ~&lt;&gt;~ Captain Jack Sparrow, after charting countless seas and spending lifetimes as a navigator, could not for the life of him find where the physician was. He checked the compass but it wouldn’t sit still long enough for him to get a reading. He asked a guard who pointed in a general direction, which helped him get through exactly one hallway before getting lost again. So when the compass suddenly stopped he ran toward it. Not realizing that the halls were emptied than they should be and that the doors he pushed open were decidedly not physician doors, he entered the great hall. Balinor was definitely there but so was half of the kingdom, and all of them were looking at him. He gave a grin, as well as he could looking like a wet rat from hell. Several swords were pointed at his chest. “Good evening lads.” He rubbed his hands together, licking his lips before chugging the closest chalice. “Ah. I’ve had better.” “Enough of this nonsense” Arthur rose from his throne. “You will state your purpose or you will leave.” “I’m looking for my brother. Balinor come on out now!” He grinned and spread his arms towards the crowd. It would’ve been a rather dramatic moment if he wasn’t drunk and soaking wet or for the fact that Balinor didn’t in fact come out then. Gaius and Merlin paled. Arthur looked pensive. “Take him to the dungeons for this interruption . We will discuss this in his trial in the morning.” Morgana turned towards Arthur “Who was that man?” The King ignored his sister “Gaius did you know about this man&#x27;s existence?” “No my lord.” Gaius bowed his head. “I was led to believe that Balinor was truly the last dragon lord.” Morgana gasped. Arthur instantly looked to Merlin. He remembered who Balinor was, how upset Merlin was after his death, how Arthur was saved by the man. “This will not stand Gaius. Send word to the outer kingdoms. If one dragonlord is out there there could be more. I will not tolerate such magic in my kingdom. Not after the destruction the last dragon created.” “Yes, sire” Arthur, turned to the crowd. “I apologize for interrupting. Let us resume our feast with no more interruptions.” The room chatter started up again. Merlin pulled at his neckerchief. That man was his uncle. He had an uncle. Well he always had an uncle but Gaius was different. He was more of a father than anything. But this man meant that he wasn’t alone. There was another dragon lord, someone who understood, who could teach him, someone who could tell him about his father. If the warlock knew one thing about this man, it was that he wasn’t going to die tomorrow. Merlin couldn’t let him leave without at least talking to him. Gaius whispered to Merlin, “Well at least we know now that public interruptions are a family trait” Merlin turned red but laughed anyways. “Merlin” Arthur waved him away when he went to refill his wine. “Not now. I expect you to meet me in my chambers after this.” He rolled his eyes “certainly sire” ~&lt;&gt;~ Merlin paced the physician’s quarters. Gaius was brewing a headache remedy, unperturbed to the warlocks distress. They had left the feast early. “I have to see him” Merlin stared at him. “I assumed you would come to that conclusion. In fact it surprises me more how long it took you” Gaius teased. “I’ll need to go at night to break him out.” Gaius nodded. “By the goddess,” Merlin pulled at his neckerchief, looking straight ahead “What if there are more dragons?” His uncle looked up at that. “Hm. One can only assume that a remaining dragon lord would mean remaining dragons.” Merlin laughed “Gaius do you know what this means? Kilgharrah won’t be alone! Aithusa can grow up with her own kind! Dragons could roam freely across Albion!” “I believe you are getting ahead of yourself my boy” Gaius smiled at his ward. “But I do say that if that day comes, I shall only hope I can see it in my lifetime.” “Well then I better get started” Merlin grinned. “Oi!” Gaius threw the herb bag. “Make sure to stock up on lavender. I have a feeling these headache remedies will be needed sooner than later” Merlin tossed the bag on and ran out of the room, fueled by newfound hope. ~&lt;&gt;~ “You’re a what?” Merlin had to force his voice down. “A Captain, young lad. I sail the greatest ship in all the seven seas.... the Black Pearl” Sparrow was clearly showing off. Merlin didn’t understand why. Why should he care what his ship was named. What he did care about was that this man, his uncle was a pirate. “Let me get this straight. You’re a pirate-“ “Captain” “Whatever. And you are NOT a dragon lord of any kind?” “Well I supposed I would have the title but no if you’re wondering about the powers I’ve got none of that. Unless you count my charm of course.” Captain Jack Sparrow grinned up at his nephew from chains. Merlin had no clue why. The man had somehow snagged a wine bottle and was still drunk despite hours passing. The man didn’t even have dragon lord abilities! “What do you mean by title?” “They’re called dragonlord for a reason. Well there’s always the dragon la- what did you say your name was again?” “Merlin.” “Right. And who are you?” Jack stumbled as he peered his head through the bars, making his chains jingle. “I’m... Gaius sent me. I’m his ward.” Merlin wasn’t sure he wanted to tell this man anything. “Ah! So you can tell me where my brother is!” Merlin tugged at his neckerchief. “Balinor.” Jack encouraged him with a nod “He passed. He died protecting the kingdom.” Jack looked thoughtful for a moment. Why would the compass send him here if Balinor was dead? Of course he was sad over the news but there was always the chance. He had heard about the purge. Never heard anything from his brother in nearly two decades. Not since Jack ran away. “Why would he protect a kingdom that wanted him dead? Apparently that’s what you lot are doing. Killing people for things they can’t control.” Jack sounded uncharacteristically sombre. “He...” Merlin fought away tears. The wounds were still fresh. “He did it for his son” The captain was broken out of his sombre mood with a large grin and a sparkle in his eye, which unnerved him. “Where is he? The son?” “The son?” Merlin choked. “Yes! Help me out so I can talk to him!” Jack shook his chains. Merlin glanced to where the guards were passed out. “I wouldn’t need to break you out for that” “Don’t be like-“ Sparrow grinned like he was planning something (He was). He leaned against the cell wall and took in his nephew “So it’s Merlin aye?” He took out his compass which pointed clearly to the boy and then fell. “Hm. You’ll have to do.” “What are you going on about?” Merlin couldn’t wrap his head around the pirate. Was his father like this? Did he just not know him long enough? Oh goddess what if he looked like him when he matured. Merlin shuddered. “You’re a dragonlord? Secret language and all?” He nodded. “Then sneak me out of here tonight and meet me at my ship before we leave in three days.” “And who says I’ll help you escape?” Merlin gave him his best Gaius eyebrow ™. “Them” he replied cheerfully, pointing towards the two guards now with swords to Merlins back. The warlocks eyes shine gold and the guards flew back unconscious. Jack however looked livelier than ever. He shot up to stand and was practically dancing for joy. “You’re magic!!” He laughed like a madman. Merlin tried to keep a smile off his face. His entire life he was taught to fear his magic. To only use it in emergencies. To hide it or else. But here was his uncle, cheering for him. A man he had known less than a day. “Balli would be so proud of you! Between you and me he never got how to do wordless spells. He was more focused on ‘theories’ and ‘taking care of his flock’” Merlin blushed. Any doubt he had about coming here vanished. Gaius and his mother never spoke about his father. They never encouraged his abilities. They taught him to control. Merlin could finally find out about where he comes from. About his people! Jack stuck his head in between the bars. Then it came back to him. The guards. The cells. The chains. The looming trial. “Let’s get you out of here then.” They both smiled mischievously. ~&lt;&gt;~ They should really fix the prison situation . He thought. But then rescuing people might become more difficult. It’s fine. Merlin had gone to visit Arthur in his chambers afterwards. He needed an alibi for when Jack actually broke out. Duplicating a key was rather easy once he didn’t have to hide his magic. He didn’t knock as he entered the King chambers with the headache remedy from Gaius. “One of these days Merlin you’ll learn to knock.” Arthur said without even looking up from his papers. “Don’t deny it. You’d go crazy with some pushover” Merlin dropped the vial loudly in front of the king. He knew Arthur enough to know he was a few drinks in. Arthur became serious. “What are your thoughts on the dragonlord?” “ The dragonlord from today sire?” “No the chef! Yes the dragonlord from today you halfwit-” Arthur covered his face. He looked exhausted. Taking care of a kingdom would do that to a person. Especially one who planned on bettering it.The mead didn’t hurt “When the great dragon attacked Camelot it damaged our land, people homes, their families, entire crops. I was so eager to find a solution. When Gaius told us about the last one. That Bell-“ “Balinor.” Merlin said before he could stop himself. Thankfully Arthur just turned a soft look his way. “Thank you Merlin. When Balinor was found I was thrilled to be saving my people. Except then my father told me about the dragonlords.-“ Merlin listened even closer. Did Uther know something that not even Gaius knew? “- told me about the kind of power a single man could hold. How he could devastate kingdoms all with a single command. The complete control over these massive beasts. No man should hold that much power Merlin. Did you know my father ordered me to kill Balinor after the dragon?” His heart stopped. He begged Arthur in his mind not to listen to Uther. To be the man Merlin always believed he was. “Arthur-“ The warning bells rang. Dammit sparrow! I wanted to hear that! Arthur launched out of his seat and grabbed his sword. “Stay here” he told Merlin before racing towards the dungeons. Merlin however was too busy replaying the image of his fathers death except this time with Arthur’s sword straight through his chest. ~&lt;&gt;~ Arthur was more irritating than usual. Probably due to losing his precious sleep from the patrols out looking for the pirate. Merlin didn’t have this issue. He didn’t even get any sleep and he was fine. Mostly. He would probably take a nap in the antechamber later but that was expected. The antechamber was his new favourite place to hide from Arthur. Since Arthur had ‘hidden’ it behind a tapestry when Merlin was first appointed and had never revealed it. It was probably another thing just to get him to quit but Merlin was 99% Arthur had forgotten about it. Either way he definitely thought Merlin was unaware. Especially since Merlin had stolen the key years ago and Arthur never even questioned it. Currently, a certain pirate uncle was hiding out there, waiting for a disguise in order to flee to his ship. He had hidden there all night while the patrols searched the town. Maybe madness did run in the family. Arthur gave him a larger than usual amount of chores and spent half his day beating up wooden posts. Or as he would call it. Training. Merlin was only thankful he didn’t call for a hunt. So while Arthur was occupied, Merlin stole some of Arthur’s old tunics and trousers, a bucket of water and an apple. He deserved it after their conversation last night. He snuck into the antechamber to find the pirates head stuck in his boot. He laughed. Jack jumped and the boot fell onto the floor, he smiled as soon as he saw who it was. “ Nephew !” Merlin turned red. He tossed the apple to Jack. Jack took a bite, and used it to gesture to the clothing “What are those ghastly things?” “Your disguise. You need to appear as an everyday citizen of Camelot and not some swashbuckling pirate.” “Well couldn’t I just go as a woman?” He tried. “I’ve got the hair” “I can’t believe I’m saying this but, I couldn’t find a dress that was fitting.” They laughed. Yup. Definitely mad, the pair of them. It was true though. Gwens would never fit him, besides he didn’t like stealing from Gwen, the cook would kill him, and anything from Morgana would attract more attention if anything. “Give those here then.” Jack made a grabby motion. Merlin turned around. When he turned back though Jack looked pretty much the same. Merlin frowned. Grabbing the bucket of water and cloth, he started scrubbing Jack&#x27;s face, much to the older man&#x27;s dismay. “You’re crazier than I am mate if you think it’s coming off!” Merlins eyes glowed as he used a polishing spell. Close enough. He looked better. Well less conspicuous. Shinier. The hair had to be dealt with but Merlin figured pulling it back and wearing a cloak could help. He did just that. “This is...” Merlin tried to look objectively at the man. “Crazy?” “Acceptable. I don’t think anyone got a good enough look at you before to tell. Besides you hardly fit the description of eccentric crazy pirate dragonlord now do you?” Merlin smiled. “At least on the outside.” “And don’t you forget it! Where are those headed?” Jack nodded towards the pirate clothes and items sitting on the bed. “They’ll get back to you. But I need to know what I’m signing up for.” Merlin took a deep breath. “I have a destiny here. With Arthur. I can’t leave him unattended. I have to be here to protect him.” “Is your destiny more important to you than your heritage. Your very being?” Jack drawled. “What do you mean?” Merlin leaned in. “I have recently come into possession of a certain map. This map contains all known locations of the last dragon eggs.” He gasped and stumbled back. More dragons. He could nearly cry. More dragons! Kilgharrah wouldn’t be alone! Aithusa can know her own kind! “I thought Aithusa was the last one. That’s why you needed my father. Why you need a dragonlord” Jacks eyes widened. “You’ve hatched one. I guess we’ll have to mark Albion off the list then.” “How many are there?” Merlins voice was barely a whisper. “Fifty give or take.” This time Merlin really did tear up. “Fifty. And you’re going to hatch them?” “As many as we can.” “Why? The eggs are worth much more than you could possibly imagine. That’s what pirates do right?” “Merls. I may not have the abilities of my brother but I know how important they were to him. I would never sell the dragons.” He needed to talk to Gaius. The boy wiped his face and cleared his throat. “The eggs however once hatched.” He whistled. “A little glue, stuff it with dirt and you’ve got a fortune right there. It doesn’t hurt that no one else can hatch it.” Merlin laughed. It was a little rough sounding but only because he couldn’t imagine that many dragons free. It seems like a dream. “Three days?” “Three days. Oh and I don’t supposed I should let you know that you’ve just gotta hold onto the compass and focus on what you need. It’ll do the rest for you, lead you straight to the Black Pearl.” “But won’t you need it to get there?” Merlin asked confused. He thought that the Captain didn’t have magic. “Nah. I’ve got my nose. I can always tell when my lady is nearby.” He tapped it to prove a point. And with that Captain Jack Sparrow left. ~&lt;&gt;~ Merlin was acting weird. Weirder than normal. It unnerved Arthur. He briefly wondered if it had anything to do with that dragonlord. Merlin had gotten so upset over the last one. Maybe it wasn’t right to bring it up last night. Arthur tried taking Merlin out for an afternoon hunt but it seemed to make the matter worse. Merlin seemed to be deep in thought. Constantly . Which was odd considering up till now Arthur had considered the space between his over large ears empty. Merlin was not amused when Arthur confessed this to him. Arthur tried everything. He tried a hunt. He tried giving Merlin more work. He tried giving Merlin less work. That one turned out worse than he imagined. Somehow the manservant who hates his job, who refused to do half of it, was very territorial, for lack of a better word, over the armoury. Arthur even asked what was wrong, in his own way of course, but he couldn’t snap Merlin out of it. It became too much when Arthur caught him having an argument with himself, pacing the room, occasionally muttering about good points or alternatives. “Merlin.” The boy waved him off. Then froze and turned towards the King. “ Merlin” “Uh...Hello” “ Hello ?! Merlin you’ve been out of sorts for days and the best you have is hello?!” He shushed him. Shushed . “I’ve been thinking” “Don’t hurt yourself there Merlin” Arthur nudged his shoulder but stilled when he realized Merlins stoic expression. That never ended well he sighed. “Alright then. What have you been thinking about so much?” “I...Need time off.” Merlin couldn’t look Arthur in the eye. “Time off? Is Hunith well?” Merlin never asked for time off. Joked of course but he never actually took the days Arthur gave him off. His mother was the only reason he could think of. “She’s fine.” He started pacing again. Arthur rubbed his eyes. “All right Merlin. I’ll send for George and you can spend tomorrow doing whatever you need to do.” He didn’t like not knowing but Merlin was sometimes cryptic and Arthur had just learned to accept that. “No not tomorrow. Well yes tomorrow but I need more time” Arthur put his arms on his manservant&#x27;s shoulders to stop him. He grabbed the bottom of his chin to get Merlin to look at him. Once the blue eyes locked onto his he spoke. “Merlin. Tell me what’s going on.” “I can’t tell you.” He said with those large eyes. “ Merlin ” “... there are things I haven’t told you. Can’t tell you. And if I tell you, you’ll hate me, you’ll never want to see me again. And then I can’t protect you. But if I don’t tell you I would hate myself for not going. Because every part of me needs to do this. But I can’t leave Camelot” Arthur wanted to laugh at the idea of Merlin having to protect him but he stopped himself. He knew from the moment he met Merlin that there was something about him that made him so Merlin. If this was his chance to get an answer, he wouldn’t risk it. “You could never make me hate you.” Merlin was quiet for a moment. He flitted through emotions as he processed. “Would you have killed the dragonlord?” At Arthur’s confused expression, he continued “the one from the feast. Would you have listened to him or would he be dead if not for his escape?” “I suppose that depends. If he was trying to hurt Camelot I wouldn’t be able to let that stand.” “But if he was just looking for Balinor? If he wasn’t a threat?” Arthur couldn’t see why this mattered to him but answered anyways. “I would have to banish him. After the ruckus he created and announced his status like that. It wouldn’t do Camelot well to have that go unpunished, lest the news spread.” Merlin was deep in thought and then jumped away from Arthur. “I just remembered I have rounds to do for Gaius.” Without looking back at the King, he left. Stealing From a King is Easier Than You Would Think Although going to see Gaius was really an excuse to get out of there, Merlin did end up going to the physician. “Gaius I need to tell him!” He hurried through the door only to stop in his tracks once he saw who was in there. Morgana was getting her headache draft from Gaius. Gwen was helping Gaius with the bottling. Morgana, once she found out she had magic, went to the druids for help. She spent two years there learning to control her magic. When she came back however, she wasn’t the same person. She was lighter, she wasn’t burdened by her visions anymore. Instead her and Gwen dedicated time to interpret them. Now she only went to Gaius for little things such as headache remedies, because she was spending most of her time reading and studying Merlins book of spells. Which Merlin had memorized long ago and which Morgana thought was from Gaius as an apology. Morgana brightened at the idea of gossip, especially from Merlin. “Tell him what Merlin?” Morgana smirked and Merlin was grateful in that moment that she was on their side. Just play dumb. Everybody thinks that of you anyway . “Who’s Merlin? Fuck .” He reddened under the girls&#x27; laughter. “Gaius I’ll go get that lavender you needed” The warlock spun to run out of the room but Morgana dragged him inside and pushed him into a chair, using her magic. He looked to his uncle for support but only found a half hidden grin. He should’ve known. “Is it Arthur?” Morgana questioned. “Well that’s a waste of a question if I’ve ever heard of one.” Gwen said . Oh great now it’s all three of them . “ Who else does Merlin moan on and on about? The real question is what’s the secret? It must be big if we don’t even know about it” Morgana looked at Gwen, dreamy eyed. “I’m allowed to have secrets!” Merlin spluttered. “No you’re not!” the two chorused, and broke out in giggles after. Merlin took another glance at Gaius, who returned with an eyebrow that could be read as morgana already knows that you know about her magic. If you tell her about the dragonlord issue you might have someone else on your side. Merlin huffed. Gaius was right. He found himself caring less and less about keeping his secrets when he didn’t need to really deal with the consequences if he left. It was a lot easier knowing that if he got banished he had somewhere and if he was to be executed he wouldn’t want to be in Camelot if Arthur didn’t want him to be. “I need time off to go on a quest of sorts.” He started. Morgana and Gwen clearly didn’t think he would say anything but leaned closer as if it would make a difference. The warlock continued. “I have an uncle” they looked at Gaius. “Different uncle” he clarified. “But I thought it was just you, your mother and Gaius” Gwen furrowed her eyebrow. “It is. But a couple years ago I met my father. ” Gwen gasped. “I found out that Uther wanted him executed during the purge but he escaped to Ealdor where he met my Mum. He had to go into hiding in order to not endanger her and only afterwards did my mother find out about me. He didn’t even know I existed and he had planned to teach me so many things to make up for lost time” his heart ached. “He was killed though. On our way back to Camelot. By bandits.” Morgana was unreadable. He could see that she was upset about the mention of the purge and about Uther but he could also see the wheels turning in her head. She was always too clever. “Your father was a sorcerer.” Morgana stared. He straightened himself in his chair. “Yes he was. He was also a dragonlord.” Morgana laughed in disbelief. Gwen dropped one of the vials and it smashed all over the floor. Morgana cleaned it up with a single spell. “This explains so much! Doesn’t it Gwen?! Oh Merlin why didn’t you tell us sooner?!” Gaius chuckled and patted his ward on the shoulder as he walked to grab another vial. “I’d like to know as well Merlin .” A familiar voice said. His heart was about to give out. Merlin was out of his chair in a flash. “Arthur!” he gasped. “Do you need help, sire?” Gaius asked. “Yes actually.” He turned to Gaius. “I’d like to know why my idiot of a manservant is telling my sister about his deep dark secrets and not the person who was literally asking him just minutes ago. Care to explain?” Morgana groaned. “Not everything is about your ego Arthur!” “Morgana, it&#x27;s okay,” Merlin said. “Can we have a minute?” She looked appalled before storming out, followed by Gwen and Gaius. Arthur pulled a still to sit across from Merlin and straddled it. “Explain” “How much did you hear?” “All of it. You’re really not as clever as you think you are Merlin .” He couldn’t hear any hatred in his voice and that alone slowed his ever increasing heart rate. At Merlins blank stare, he sighed. “When were you going to tell me?” “You’re okay with this?!” He tugged at his neck. “I’m still processing things.” Merlin was at a loss for words. “I was going to tell you in your chambers. But I couldn’t. You’d have found out before the week was done. Probably .” “Probably?!” The king scoffed. “I didn’t know if I was going to go! I want to but I can’t leave Camelot Arthur! If I had decided to stay you probably wouldn’t have found out!” “And where were you going?” Arthur tried to keep his tone even. Kingly. He needed to keep his composure in front of his manservant. Because if he had even one crack he would become a mess. He wasn’t sure how he was even this together. He knew there was something about Merlin but this was something . Merlin was a dragonlord if Arthur was putting the pieces together right. His father must’ve been Balinor from the story. Which means Arthur had told him that he was supposed to kill his best friends father. He was honestly glad he didn’t have to do it, not that he’d ever say it out loud, because it meant that Merlin wasn’t crying because of him. It also meant that Merlin was the one to release the strange dragonlord from the feast. It meant that Merlin had more family than before and Arthur was almost glad he wouldn’t have to meet another. “Jack” Ah so that was the mans name . “Has a map. Of dragon eggs! I could hatch them Arthur! Dragons could roam Albion freely as they once did!” Merlin grabbed his hands and squeezed them. They were sitting so close their knees were almost touching. He hated how Merlins eyes lit up. Because Arthur knew deep down, that Merlin would leave. He knew that if he had to stay it he would regret it. “Why can’t he do it? Why do you have to leave?” Arthur practically begged. He would go mad without Merlin. He needed him. He couldn’t just go away. “It doesnt work that way. It’s only first borns. Jack has no power.” The warlock must have sensed his distress because he held on tighter. As if it would make up for anything. “But you do. You can hatch them? Aren’t they dangerous?” The warlock seemed interested in his boots “I’ve hatched one before. Her names Aithusa. They aren’t dangerous Arthur. Not to me or anybody else. Not when they’re raised properly. They’re intelligent creatures. Not beasts.” “But the great dragon-!” Arthur stammered. “- was imprisoned underground for 20 years. Desperation and hate make people do terrible things.“ Merlin said seriously, as if he knew the feeling all too well. “I hate it when you act wise.” Merlin made too much sense. He didn’t like the Great dragon (who he assumed is alive because he knew Merlin wouldn’t be able to kill it) but he understood the reason. He understood why Merlin kept this from him and despite the reason why he knows now, he’s just glad he knows. “Arthur” Merlin&#x27;s voice was above a whisper. “ I have something else to tell you.” “Is this the last secret?” Merlin looked confused. “I’m not sure how much more I can handle in one night. But I can’t handle anymore secrets between us.” He said. Except maybe one that he would never speak out loud to anyone. Especially Merlin. But he could keep it buried down. It didn’t need to affect anyone. “Last one.” Merlin chuckled weakly. He took a deep breath and shook out his body. He glared into his hands as his eyes glowed gold. “ Hine on ylde eft gewunigen wilgesiþas, þonne wig cume” Arthur pushed away from his chair as he took in the sight. The guiding light that saved him “Well shit.” He laughed. Merlin smiled sheepishly up at him. He pulled at his hair. Pointing to the light, “how long?” His voice did not crack thank you. “I was born with it.” “Right.” Arthur felt a bit queasy thinking of the implications of that. Especially since the purge happened. “And is that...common?” “No. I’m pretty sure I’m the only one.” “Only you Merlin.” He laughed, it was a weak sound. He really was losing it wasn’t he? “I need some time to think. It’s a lot.” Merlin nodded. He made a point to show he was leaving. “Have today off.” Merlin almost looked defeated. That wouldn’t do. Then he had a thought. “Can your” he made crude gestures to indicate magic. “Heat up stuff?” The warlock snorted. “What do you think I used it for?” “Tomorrow morning I expect a warm room, no cold stone floor! And a hot bath! And two breakfasts. Because we&#x27;re going to talk about this, just later” The king said softly. Merlin looked much better than he did a second ago. “Later.” He nodded. Then added “prat” Arthur only shook his head as he left. ~&lt;&gt;~ The next morning proceeded to be eventful. Merlin was practically glowing. It made something twist inside of Arthur but he ignored it. The room was as he had asked for it. They are breakfast together as Merlin rambled about magic. It felt strange for Arthur to listen about it. Like an outsider. There was so much of Merlin he didn’t know. The two also wrote up a rough draft on the legalization of magic. Not that Merlin knew that. It was going to be his going away present. Merlin also explained the trip. How long he guessed it would take and the maps. Once he got into the hypotheticals he zoned out. Merlin was leaving. He kept saying he didn’t know but Arthur knew. And after this he wasn’t sure if he could physically take Merlin away from him. However. It was the last day for Merlin to go. The ship would be leaving with or without him. He had everything set up so Arthur wouldn’t need anything.Merlin had said goodbye to Morgana and Gwen. He said goodbye to the knights and to Gaius. Arthur held him tight for nearly a minute before he could physically let him go. It felt too short. Arthur’s heart hurt as he saw Merlins figure in the courtyard that night. It hurt as he saw him take his last look at the city and wave to Arthur. It hurt as he saw the man take out a compass and walk south until Arthur couldn’t pick out his figure anymore. ~&lt;&gt;~ It took Merlin a few days to get his sea legs . He was a farmer&#x27;s son, he never went out to sea, never mind live out in it. He spent this time locked up in the cabins, trying not to throw up and then doing just that. Once he got past that he understood why people were drawn to the sea. When he finally made it above board the sky was calm and the sea was an endless blue. The Black Pearl was sailing casually through the almost crystal waters. The air was different too, he noticed, the salt in it made it feel fresher despite the shape of the ship he was on. He was taken out of his thoughts when someone nearly knocked him over with a pat on the back. “Nice of you to finally join us in the land of the living Hatchling !” The Captain yelled. There was a shouting ‘YARR’ amongst the crew in greeting. “This here be my nephew and if any of you don’t think he’s fit to be here” He glared at the crew “You’d be right.” Jack laughed and pushed Merlin again. Oh no. He’s worse than Arthur! “But he’s the only thing that can help us! Let’s turn him into one of our own savvy?” Jack gave him a look that did not help his sea sickness in any way. The crew didn’t seem to care after and went back to what they were doing. Jack grabbed Merlin&#x27;s coat and dragged him to the captain&#x27;s quarters. “Let’s look at this map shall we?” Jack pranced around the room looking for the map. “Ah ha!” He grabbed a parchment in the worst state he had ever seen. It was orange with age and the paper practically fell apart when you touched it. The real treasure was what was written. The warlock hunched over it and caressed one of the x marks. The one for Aithusa. “This is…. better than I could have ever imagined.” Merlin breathed. He knew that there were at least 50 but seeing it in person made it much more real. “Which one are we hatching first?” He looked up to Jack, anxious to get started. Jack however was startled for a moment because he saw his brother just then. They had the same eyes. The same expressions that Balinor used to look at him with when talking about dragons. He cleared his throat. “This one.” He pointed to a mark that was far south from Camelot. So far south that it was away from Albion and closer to the giant land mass that was east. There was a single one there. Farther down close to the shore were three eggs. “How long will it take to sail there?” “Depends on how much trouble we get in.” Jack grinned. He then spun around and dig through a chest. He threw clothes at Merlin. “Put these on. If anyone sees you out here looking like that they’ll think you’re worth something and that won’t do. “ Merlin almost protested and then he realized that Jack meant money. “Fine. But the scarf stays.” “The scarf stays” Jack shrugged. The clothes his uncle gave him were strange. But so was Jack. The shirt was white with too large sleeves that were tight at the wrist. A dark blue vest that had some crest he didn’t recognize on the buttons. The boots were similar to his own only they weren’t falling apart at the seams. All of it was much softer than he was used to. He laughed. “Are these nobleman&#x27;s clothing?” “Where did you think we got our stuff? Nobody sells to a pirate kid. Let that be the first lesson.” Arthur barely allowed Merlin to take his old clothing never mind this. He really didn’t expect to be wearing such fine things while at sea. Merlin snorted. “Unless that’s a problem for you boy?” Merlin grinned. “It’s actually the opposite of a problem.” Jack matched his grin. ~&lt;&gt;~ He was put to work soon after. One of the crew, Billy, helped Merlin with making different knots. He was surprised to find that for a pirate he was patient and encouraging. He liked the man. Merlin was finding himself surprised more than not as of late. He had expected a pirate crew would act like a bunch of bandits who weren’t actively trying to kill you, but in reality it reminded him of the Knights. How they were loud and boisterous but there was a brotherhood between them. He had finally managed to do a bowline knot when a sword was put into his face. The handle was mere inches from his nose. Barbossa shoved it closer. “You ever held one of these?” “I practice with… practiced with Arthur all the time. I never got the hang of it.” Merlin said as he took the handle. The sword was different from what he was used to. He knew swords despite what Arthur would say. He couldn&#x27;t use one to save his life but he knew how they felt in his hand, the weight of a blade, the angles the metal took. He had cleaned dozens of blades countless times. This sword however was lighter. With a curved end and a closed handle. The blade itself was thinner and smaller. He gave an experimental swing. He smiled. Maybe it wouldn’t be so bad. In a second , Barbossa drew out a second blade and the sound of metal crashing interrupted the quiet. Merlin shocked everyone (including himself) to see that he met Barbossa&#x27;s blade. He laughed. “Don’t get cocky Lad.” Barbossa attacked again. It went on for a while. Merlin was a natural. He knew the swings and the movements from so many years of watching the knights practice and in battle, from Arthur trying to teach him for almost a year before giving up. The sword however was much better suited for him. Merlin was able to be quicker on his feet and with the blade. The swords clashed again and again in a dance. Barbossa hit him on the arm with the flat edge. They paused. “‘Never got the hang of it’ what bullshit! Where’ve you been hiding this one Jack?!” Barbossa playfully yelled to the Captain. Jack, who sometime during the fight, came to watch, chuckled. “This ain’t anything! Magic man why are you holding out on us?” Merlin glanced at the sword, confused. “This is what I’ve got.” Jack sighed. He waved his hands around in circles. Oh he meant his magic. “Isn’t that cheating?” “Kid we’re pirates. It&#x27;s practically in the code” Barbossa said. “Look how I see it, is that when you’re fighting it really only stops when the other either escapes or can’t keep going. There’s not rules at sea. There’s not really anything to stop you from doing anything. Nobody cares about fair. It’s kill or be killed and use what you have.” One of the crew members, Jean, said. “Huh” it made sense out at sea but everything in Merlin told him to be noble, to be the better person, but if they wanted magic. Merlin smirked. He swung his blade at Barbossa. The man was caught off guard but quickly went into the same dance as before. Merlin used his magic to tip a bucket and pour water behind Barbossa. He moved back and slipped onto his ass. “Now you’re getting it!” Jack cheered. Merlin understood now why Arthur likes dueling. It was freeing, in a strange way, there were no responsibilities, only you, your sword and your opponent. And using his magic, in public was something else. After keeping it locked up for years. Merlin pointed his sword at Barbossa&#x27;s throat. He held out a hand to pull the older man up, only for a sword to come swinging at his wrist. “What the fuck?!” He launched back but because of the water he tripped. “No rules Lad!” Barbossa grinned with a sword now at Merlin&#x27;s throat. His eyes glowed and the sword went hot and flung itself into the ship. Merlin tripped Barbossa with his leg and jammed his blade into his chest. “Yield” he let some of his dragonlord voice out. “Fine!” The second in command held his hands up in surrender. “Parlay?” “No!” The crew shouted. “Where in the seven seas did you find this one?” Barbossa asked once he got up on his own. “I stole him from a king.” Jack said proudly. “Not what happened.” Merlin deadpanned. “Absolutely what happened.” Merlin shook his head and went back to Billy. He ignored the curious look on the mans face and grabbed some rope. “So knots.” I’d Give the Docks a Solid 3 out of 5 Stars The first time the Black Pearl docked was a disaster. That is to say Jack saw it as a raging success (At least at first). They were at the edge of a large city. The only real difference Merlin could find between here and Camelot was the accents. Jack apparently could understand every word (they were speaking English but the Captain was fluent in mumbling and strange phrasing) Merlin on the other hand felt as though he finished one of Gaius&#x27;s anatomy tomes with the size of a headache he had. When they docked most of the crew scattered into the city. Jack handed Merlin a small pouch of miscellaneous coins and patted him on the back. He went to the tavern first. For food. He had a potato filled soup and some mead like drink called Rum. It wasn’t horrible. Better than anything Gaius had his take though. Afterwards he wandered around the city markets. It felt odd. He was used to everyone in Camelot knowing him. He was the Kings right hand after all. He couldn’t get anything from the town without getting stopped at least a couple times. Here however he was a complete stranger. There was no Mary the barmaid or John the baker, only Merlin and unfamiliar faces. Merlin managed to figure out the currency. Only after several confusing minutes at the tavern. He was at the blacksmiths, looking for a sword of his own. He was using Barbossa&#x27;s extra currently but he wanted something that was truly his. Something he chose for himself for once. He was smitten with a plain but durable blade. He had listened to enough of Gwen and Elyans rantings to know the difference between functionality and decoration. He was particularly drawn to it because despite being plain, the handle had a dragon on it. His feet stumbled under him, which was odd since he was standing still. The dragonlord felt a tug in his chest It felt like Kilgharrah during his first night in Camelot. It should be impossible. Making a quick decision, he paid the blacksmith, took his sword, and followed the tug. It led him to a tavern, different to the one he was in before. As soon as he went inside he knew what he was looking for. Not because he had any clue what it would be, but rather that the pull had become so intense that he couldn’t not look at her. It was a woman, a pirate. She reminded him of Princess Elena in which she was disheveled and unladylike but was content to be so. Other than that there were no real similarities. She had dark eyes and brown skin, her hair was held back with a bandana made from the same cloth as her casual dress. She was talking to her companion, another woman, when she made eye contact with Merlin. The other woman looked as well and gasped. “Emrys.” She reminded him of Freya, wide eyed despite being beaten down. Merlin blushed. “Uh. It’s actually Merlin.” He gestured towards the empty seat. “Do you mind if I sit here?” “No! I mean yes! Please sit!” The second woman tanned herself. “I’m Harriet .” When she moved her arm, her sleeve raised to reveal a Druid tattoo. The other woman eyed him curiously. “Jolene. But everyone calls me Jo. Why are you here Emrys?” “Merlin” he corrected. “ and I’m not really sure I was pulled here. Are you both druids?” “ I am” Harriet said “Jo’s one of those dragon ladies. Itreally is an honour to meet you. Is it true what they say about you? Have you really seen Avalon?” Merlin nodded, remembering the whole Sophia incident. He tugged at his shirt. Harriet looked ready to faint. “Dragonladies?” He looked at Jo. He didn’t think she looked like one. But then again neither did he. “Do they not have them up north?” Jo asked. “No that’s actually why I’m here, away from Camelot I mean. I’m a dragonlord, the last one.” “Well I’ll be damned.” Jo laughed. “We all knew the purge was a shit show but to knock out an entire race like that? Who does that?” “Uther.” Merlin tensed. Harriet, noticing the tension, ordered three rums. “Fuck” Merlin snorted. “You can say that again.” He took a chug of rum and felt the liquid courage. “So tell me about these dragonladies.” ~&lt;&gt;~ Dragonladies were identical to dragonlords. The only difference was the gender apparently. Merlin felt a bit dumb once she explained it. Dragonlords were the firstborn sons of dragonlords or Dragonladies. Dragonladies were the first born daughters of dragonlords or ladies. In Merlins case it was his father, he was the only son so he obtained the dragonlord abilities. If Merlin had a younger sibling they would hold the title but had no ability, just an aptitude to them. They weren’t born with the knowledge and so had to be taught the language alongside English. They would never be able to command a dragon but it hardly mattered when you had a close bond to one. Their first born children would inherit the powers as well despite slipping over their parents. In Jo’s case both of her parents were dragonnobility. Her mother was the only one with powers though. Her father had been the third child in the family. Where Jo was from, dragonlords were viewed the same as a blacksmith or a physician. It was a trade that passed down through generations, only it was much rarer to come across one. Merlin&#x27;s heart leapt when Jo told him there were a dozen families in the area alone. No one cared since there weren’t any dragons left to take care of. The lineage stayed but no one could use their powers. It took years of dedicated study to use them and no one had any reason to. Merlin told her about the map. Indirectly. He told her about Aithusa and that he was searching for more. Jo struck quickly to give Merlin a hug. “I’m coming with you.” She said. “I can’t ask that of you.” “I don’t care. Let’s make a deal. I get to come along and see the birth of a dragon and I’ll teach you about our history. You’re so so lost.” She leaned back in her chair. “What do you say?” “Deal?” “Deal.” ~&lt;&gt;~ Morgana screamed. “Are you done?” Gwen asked politely. “Not yet” She screamed once more into her pillow. Only so the guards wouldn’t rush in. She calmed her breathing and fell back on the mattress. Staring at her canopy. “I’m done now” Gwen giggled. “Do you want to talk about it?” She poured wine into two chalices and handed one to Morgana. “I’m going to kill Merlin.” Gwen hummed. She’s used to this. It’s been almost a month without Merlin and Morgana was slowly losing her mind. Apparently Merlin was responsible for much more than Arthur’s socks. In the days following his departure, Arthur locked himself up in his room and when he came out he announced to the kingdom his repeal on the magic ban. He planned to have dinner with the druids to discuss their thoughts in actually addressing the issues, but until then he made damn sure that Camelot would no longer be prejudiced against sorcerers. Morgana nearly cried. Then she did when she was alone in her chambers. She worried for so long that Arthur would be exactly like Uther, that he would be blinded by the same hate. But Arthur had done this without even knowing about Morgana. The poor boy thought she went to the druids to cure her headaches. It was later than evening that she came out to Arthur. He took it surprisingly well. He asks her how long she had been using them and even thanked her for trusting him. If it didn’t Morgana so damn happy she would’ve checked to see if he was under some kind of spell. (He wasn’t) Since then she took the place of court sorcerer. Which meant that she dealt with the public’s image of magic as well as defending Camelot from magical attacks. It occurred to her that this was taken care of by Merlin before here. He was a lot more efficient than she was. But Morgana shook it off as years of practice. It seemed that Camelot was getting attacked every week. More frequently now that magic was being legalized. There were those who were against it who attack and those who resented Arthur for it, despite having magic themselves that attacked. Additionally there were ones who were just mad about Arthur. For something he did in his youth. Which to be fair was a lot of dumb shit. Morgana felt pulled in every direction. Everywhere she turned someone needed something. Arthur needed her advice, Gwaine questioned about using magic to make apples larger, Gauis asked for her to help make his potions longer lasting since Merlin did it before. And that was only on top of her usual duties, her court sorcerer duties, deciphering her visions and protecting the city. So yes, Morgana wanted to kill Merlin for leaving her. She wanted to kill him for changing Arthur into the man he was now because otherwise she wouldn’t be a court sorcerer and have to deal with all of the bullshit. But most importantly she wanted to kill Merlin because him leaving made her realize how much she missed having him around. ~&lt;&gt;~ They found Jack getting chased by two of the city&#x27;s guards. He had a large bottle of rum in one hand and a large sack in the other. Merlin tossed Barbossa&#x27;s old sword to Jo and fended off one of the guards with his own. Jack didn’t seem to care about them defending him because he just kept running towards the ship. “Really appreciate the help!” Merlin yelled at him as he deflected a hit. With a good flash, a net fell from the fisherman’s stall and onto the guards. They ran after Jack. He was worried that once Jack got aboard they would set sail, with or without him. He didn’t need to worry about it much since the whole crew was being held at swordpoint by a swarm of knights. He couldn’t help notice that their capes were dull and chain mail was sticky. Which meant it had rusted before getting cleaned. Or it could be because of the ocean air. Merlin knew what it did to their movements. It made it harder to manoeuvre and it would slow them down. As soon as the pair were spotted they were held up as well. “Gibbs you owe me! I told you he’d be back!” Jack cheered. “Who’s the lady?” Gibbs asked. Merlin smirked. “I stole her” There was a loud cackle out of the captain before the sword was pressed into his neck. “State your business pirate” the knight spat. “Who says I have business? What even is business? Why are any of us here? I’ll tell you-“ “Shut it!” The knight ordered. Jack made eye contact with Merlin and waved his hands. He continued rambling. “-that! What is your purpose sir knight?! How can any of us-“ With a flash, the knights were all pushed away. Some even fell into the water and had to latch onto the dock. The chain mail would make it too heavy for them to get on it. Jack beamed. “Do you know how much easier this is now? Bones, tell your king he’s not getting you back” Merlin wasn’t sure if he was joking or not. While they were distracted, several knights got back up and drew their swords. “Ah can’t escape some of it, though it does always get the blood pumping no?” Jack sighed. Merlin couldn’t help but agree. He always thought Arthur was crazy for wanting to spend so much time training but he understood it now. The feeling was unmatched. He hit a rather large knight in the shoulder where he knew for a fact hurt rather terribly after training. The large knight went down quickly. They others seemed to think that Merlin was their biggest threat. He was but that was beside the point. Five of them surrounded him at once. More knights had starting getting back up. He tried to think of a strategy but his sword was quickly met with another. He fought him and another knight off while keeping his back away from the three other knights. With a push of his magic, two knights were tied up with nearby dock rope. The third one was being taken care of by Billy. He glanced around to see where the others had gone. Jack was attempting to sneak back onto the ship, Gibbs and Barbossa were fighting a knight each. Jo grabbed the sack Jack stole and was moving her way through to the ship. Merlin focused his attention back to the knight and finished it by jamming his handle into the helmet and knocking the guard out. He remembered the second knight a moment too late. A sword was buried to the hilt in his stomach. He caught a glimpse of Barbossa taking the man out before he fell. He was numbly aware of blood pouring out of the wound, sword still in, when he felt a burst of magic. The remaining two knights were knocked unconscious and any of the crew around him fell back. He saw spots in his vision. Gaius is going to kill me for this . ~&lt;&gt;~ “Shit” Jack said. None of them could look away from the dead body. Merlin&#x27;s dead body. “What the fuck do we do?!” Jo’s voice was hoarse, trying not to cry. “He can’t die like this! He’s Emrys!” “Who?” Barbossa asked but was ignored. “We have to take him to the Pearl Captain.” Gibbs said solemnly. “Can’t leave ‘im here. Take ‘im back to Camelot.” Jack was broken out of his trance, chugged the rest of his rum and went back to his normal persona. “Get a move on then” He turned his back and went straight into the Captains Quarters. Gibbs and Bo’sun grabbed an end of Merlin and got him onto the ship. ~&lt;&gt;~ Arthur visited Gaius’s for the third time that day. He knew that practically he should’ve been working on a speech or doing something kingly, but he couldn’t stop himself from going back there. He missed Merlin. He was trying to hold it together for the sake of the Kingdom but all he wanted to do was lock himself in his chambers until he came back. Everything was wrong. Gaius wasn’t the same. He was quieter like he was missing a fire inside of him. He supposed having Merlin around anyone would make them more passionate and lively. George was awful. He wasn’t actually but he was nothing compared to Merlin. George treated him like an actual king and Arthur hated it. He got it from everybody else why couldn’t he get a break in his own chambers? George had a system, which itself was foreign to Arthur, even more so when he found Merlin had one too. It was very clear in the first couple days how different they were. Merlin always woke him up late, loudly, barging into his chambers, pulling off the covers, slamming open the windows and loudly cheering “Rise and shine!” George snuck in at dawn, started the fire, had breakfast ready, and waited for Arthur to wake up before saying “Good morning sire” followed by things for the day that Arthur never paid any attention to. The first day, Arthur was cranky and tired all afternoon. He thought it was because Merlin was missing but apparently if Arthur wasn’t woken up like that, he wouldn’t actually get up until well past noon. He got worse when he realized that he barely had any time before the council meeting. When he questioned George later he said “A king should rise when he pleases and the council will wait for him no matter how long it was” Arthur wanted to fire him. He didn’t though. He had an irritating voice in his head, that sounded too much like Merlin, telling him to give him another chance. Arthur gave him very clear instructions to do what Merlin used to do. Except say “rise and shine”. That wasn’t for George. It became abundantly clear after that how much Merlin meddled with his day without him noticing. His notes were no longer organized in importance but rather neatly stacked in a pile. His clothes were now organized by occasion rather than putting Arthur’s (Merlins) favourites in the front and all the itchy clothes out of sight. His bath was no longer the perfect temperature. Arthur didn’t say anything about that one because he knew now how Merlin got it that way. It didn’t stop him from complaining to Morgana though. Merlin, after years of knowing Arthur, knew him so well that his messes were actually more for Arthur’s sake than Merlin being a slob. Arthur kept going back to Gaius’s because it was the one place in the castle that was exactly the same. That and Gaius didn’t judge him for being there. The first time Gaius had to examine him to make sure he wasn’t hurt. Now, he would give him The Eyebrow ™ and Arthur would shake his head, so he would know he wasn’t hurt. After that the physician would hand him a mortar and put him to work. Crushing things between stone was surprisingly peaceful. It gave Arthur a break, something to do with his hands and it gave him time to think. The physicians quarters had always been a safe place for Arthur, ever since he was younger and was playing hide and seek with Morgana or skiving off his duties. He stopped once he hit his teenage years but he was glad it was still here for him. He couldn’t even hide out with Morgana like he used to either. They were both swamped with duties and Morgana was getting stressed. Arthur suggested giving her a break with Gwen to go wherever they wanted but Morgana only laughed at him and muttered about how naive he was. Arthur wondered what Merlin was doing now. It hardly seemed real, him being gone. But he was and he was out exploring the world. Arthur’s world was here but he couldn’t help but wonder what he would see. After he left Arthur announced the repeal on the laws against magic. Part of him hoped that Merlin would be there. That he would somehow know, because Merlin always knew, and that Arthur would look out into that crowd and see those blue eyes shining up at him. If anything could bring him back it would be that. But despite Arthur’s hopes, he didn’t see Merlin that day or since, only hundreds of hopeful Camelot citizens looking up at him. For now that would be enough. Arthur wasn’t just doing this for Merlin, he was doing it for all of Camelot. I get stabbed hours after becoming immortal Captain Jack Sparrow was pacing the captains quarters. He refused to look at his nephew&#x27;s body that was laid down on the cot. What was he going to tell the King? Nothing probably. Maybe he’d write him a note, a really nice note, and just hope it gets there. Or maybe nobody needed to know. Merlin who? The king didn’t pay attention to a servant right? He needed to make a decision before they got off course. They had another dragonlord, dragon lady , aboard. They could finish what they started without him. Jack didn’t want to. He had to admit that Merlin had grown on him. For someone who had only met Balinor for a day they were remarkably similar. Some of his traits, his kindness, his stubbornness must’ve been from his mother. Balinor was reclusive and though he wasn’t unkind, he didn’t have the same goodness that Merlin did. His brother didn’t hesitate to make tough decisions; he cared more about the end goal than anything else. Merlin was like Balinor in other ways. Firstly they were both nerds. The number of times Jack saw his brother when Merlin was crouched over the map, muttering phrases in dragon tongue, couldn’t be counted. They looked similar as well. Jack wasn’t around to see his brother get old but when they were young and mischievous Balinor looked just like Merlin. Same smile when they knew they got away with something. The captain missed his brother even though they hadn’t seen each other for over a decade. Not since before the purge. When Jack found out about it he knew Balinor would be killed. He didn’t wait for confirmation; he mourned him then and that was it. He had hope when the compass started to point towards Balinor, it was crushed when Merlin told him what happened. Just because he prepared for it doesn’t mean it hurt any less. Especially now that his chance to bond with the last part of Balinor was gone. Jack quit pacing and finally looked at his nephew. He focused on the scarf that now wrapped around his arm. The same scarf that Jack had never seen the boy without and the same one Merlin was so insistent on keeping. I’ll send that. He thought. With the letter. We can’t have it be misread as a war declaration. Does it matter? I’m a dead man anyways is that king of his finds out . Jack leaned over Merlin to untie the knot but realized that his shirt was ripped where the sword went in but there didn’t seem to be any wound. Merlin gasped. That can’t be right. I’m not that drunk. His eyes shot open. They were entirely gold. Merlin shot right up and ended up head butting Jack in the process. Jack scrambled to the wall. “ What the fuck. What the fuck …” Jack whispered. Merlin groaned and held his head in his hands. He seemed to remember the stab wound and leaned back holding his stomach. “Who patched me up? They did an awful job.” Merlin croaked. Jack laughed at the absurdity of it all. “You were dead.” “I don’t think I look that bad.” Merlin attempted a smile. He motioned for Jack to come over. “Help me get up, I&#x27;m thirsty.” “Nah mate I don’t think so. You’re gonna try to steal my blood or eat my face off. No thank you” “What are you going on about?” Merlin asked. There was a knock on the door. The pair snapped their heads towards it. “Are you alright in there Captain? We heard voices. Barbossa said that’s just how you are but I thought I’d check.” Jo’s voice sounded on the other side of the wood. She cracked open the door and screamed. “Is there something on my face? I don’t think I look that bad, it&#x27;s just a small stab.” Merlin jokes. “Merlin, you were impaled. You’re dead. Well you were for a while anyway.” Jack said. “Oh my goddess it’s because you’re Emrys isn’t it?!” Jo gasped. “I just thought it was a figure of speech but you’re really immortal aren’t you?!” “Yeah no. Emrys is just a thing the druids call me because of Arthur’s destiny.” Merlin drawled. “Emrys means immortal.” “Oh shit.” Merlin said. “ I was dead then?” They both nodded. “Huh” “Huh?” Jo asked. “It makes sense.” Looking at their faces he continued. “I&#x27;ve been in a lot of situations where I probably should’ve died but haven’t. I can’t even count how many times I’ve been poisoned.” “I’m going to ignore that.” Jack almost fell over in relief. “This is great! You can’t die! No ones starting a war today!” Jack ran out of the room to tell Gibbs to stay on course. ~&lt;&gt;~ The crew&#x27;s reaction was varied. Most seemed relieved or shocked, Some were just used to stunts like this and went back to work, Barbossa just got up and left. The Black Pearl was in high spirits. Some of them just assumed that Merlin would take care of the battles. What with his magic, ability with a sword and undyingness. That was not the case however when a Navy ship attacked them. It was a peaceful morning. Or as peaceful of a morning you can get on the Black Pearl. Merlin spent the morning with Jo going over the maps for the millionth time. He was literally dragged out of there by Billy who made him go and help the cook. He didn’t mind that job. It was better than running around delivering messages back and forth between Sparrow and Barbossa because Jack was too lazy to go to him and Barbossa was too stubborn to go to Jack. Despite being the captain&#x27;s nephew, an immortal and a dragonlord, Merlin was the cabin boy. Jack had told him that all good sailors started where he was. That he would learn to rig the sails and learn the feel of the helm, but Merlin thought he was the manservant for the whole ship now. He was chopping vegetables for a stew, they picked up fresh food at the docks, when he heard a commotion above. He reached for his sword only to remember he left it with the maps. He took it off because it kept hitting the table and he never got the chance to put it back. He grasped the knife he was using to chop and ran up to the deck. “What’s going o-“ Merlin ducked, barely missing a shot from an enemy ship. “So that’s going on” The crew were getting into position, ready for attack. The gunners were waiting at the cannons for the Captains signal. The enemy ship, another pirate from the look of it, came into range. Merlin quickly covered his ears. His right ear partially exposed due to his hand grasped around the knife. “FIRE IN THE HOLE!” Jack practically cheered. The man was too enthusiastic about being under attack. Several loud cannons blasted into the hull of the enemy’s ship. Loud shouts were heard as the scrambled to reload on either side. Jack took his place at the helm and Merlin recognized the look in his eyes. The ship started moving at full speed, away from the other ship but directing in their line of fire. “What are you doing?! Are you insane?!” Merlin shouted. Jack laughed. “I wouldn’t be a good captain if I wasn’t!” That ship was now fully loaded and wasted no time firing. Merlin was nearly knocked off his feet from the force of impact. The sea seemed to realize their battle and the waves that were once quiet started to grow as the sky darkened. Sailing became harder and they only had a few rounds of ammunition left. The other ship caught up and pirates started climbing aboard like rodents. Merlin tried not to use his magic but he had literally brought a knife to a gunfight. His knife was now embedded in some rather rude pirates shoulder anyways. The said pirate returned his gift with a dagger in the stomach. Lucky it barely grazed him. Merlin spit blood into his face. “Real original” His eyes flashed and the man was swallowed by the waves below. He yanked the dagger out. “You think I could keep this?” He flipped it in his hand before throwing it at his attacker. “Never mind you keep it.” He felt a sudden rush of power. There was fighting all around, the black pearl was handling themselves but the other pirates seemed to flow out of their ship continuously. The warlock felt the sea call to him. The energy it possessed grew and Merlin could almost touch it. He remembered how it felt to harness that power when he defeated Nimueh, he did the same now. The whites of his eyes were gold. The sky darkened even more around them, the wind picked up and the waves were now large enough to flood the entire deck. The sky crackled with energy behind him. A single lightning bolt shot out from the sky and hit the other ship. A large fire started despite the waves and a large amount of pirates turned their attention to stopping that rather than fighting. The pirates were quickly finished off, the dozen remaining on ship being tied and gagged and brought to the cells. Merlin stumbled over his feet, the energy rush he felt before disappearing as he became bone dead tired. He vaguely recalls rough hands helping him to his hammock but the second he fell in, he was out. ~&lt;&gt;~ It’s been three months. Three months since Captain Jack Sparrow came to Camelot and changed everything. Merlin was having the time of his life. The sea became his home. The salty air which at first made him sick, now filled him with confidence and cleared his mind. He loved the water. Merlin was never around much water growing up. The closest thing he had was the lake of Avalon and he didn’t visit there often. He understood why Freya wanted to be by the water. Of course it reminded her of where she grew up but there was something liberating about it, and as someone who had been trapped for so long, she would have craved that. Merlin was no longer the errand boy. The crew agreed that his talents were wasted there and he was promoted to Third Mate. After Jack, Barbossa and Gibbs. Unfortunately as the other newest crew member Jo took over for Merlin. He would feel bad for her but she seemed to love it. Right now Merlin was hunched over the dragon egg map, as he usually was. By now the map held no secrets and he had memorized the entirety of it all in case it got destroyed, but he still like to look at it from time to time. It gave him hope seeing Albions future spread out like that. The door creaked open behind him. He heard the familiar boots of his uncle. Without looking up Merlin said. “Morning Captain” Jack chuckled. “You’re freaky mate.” That make Merlin snort. “I’ve got good news and bad news savvy?” Merlin looked up. He wasn’t able to cut his hair while aboard. Even if he found a decent knife or scissors the water made it too rocky and he’d more likely hurt himself. It was even worse when he tried to shave. He found out the wrong way that his immortality had rules. It only really brought him back from the dead and other injuries were his to deal with. His hair now was a decent length, when wet it fell into his eyes and annoyed the shit out of him. But when it was dry it took on a curl and only really became a problem when he looked up too quick, like now. He scowled at it. “Good news?” He tried to look hopeful. “We’ll finally be puttin you to good use. Less than a day&#x27;s sail to this one.” Jack stabbed the map with his finger. Merlin shot up. “I swear to the triple goddess the bad news better not be that you’re lying.” “ Why does everyone think I’m lying ?” Jack muttered to himself. He smirked at Merlin. “The bad news is that you look worse than ol hector with that shag” Jack patted Merlins growing beard. He scowled. “LAND AHOY” Merlin grabbed his sword and in a second was out of there and leaning over the ship to catch a glimpse. ~&lt;&gt;~ “Did that map of yours tell us where it would be?” Gibbs asked once the ship was docked. Merlin was practically bouncing in excitement. “Nope! But I think I’ll know. The last one required multiple parts of a key but I’m sure we’ll be fine.” Gibbs didn’t look impressed. They were on an island. Merlin guesses he could walk around the entirety of it in an hour if he wanted to. Half of the island was tall cliffs that hovered over the sea below. Merlin felt a tug. The same kind he felt before meeting Jo. He waved her over and she followed him as they got closer to the cliffs. He vaguely heard a mutter about idiots but ignored it. He reached the cliffs and felt the tug get stronger. The only issue was there wasn’t anywhere else for him to go. It was there though. “Look for any irregular rocks or symbols” he told Jo. They looked around for several minutes before Jo pointed out the water. In the crystal clear water they could see the continuation of a cliff that stopped way above the sand . As if there was a cave under there. Merlin knew instantly that’s where it was. “We have to figure out a way to get down there. Maybe there’s a spell?” He asked. Jo shrugged. “You’re Emrys.” He sighed. I’ll have to do research now. Gaius would be proud. When they met up with the rest of the crew they all worryingly looked at the Captain. Jack however was grinning ear to ear. ~&lt;&gt;~ “You are a madman. This is insane. You are completely insane. I can’t believe we’re doing this” Merlin ranted. His arms started to strain from holding up the canoe. “Why thank you. I’m told it’s my best quality. I’ve always wanted to try this.” Jack grinned despite being in the same position. “I can’t believe I got stuck with you.” They were holding up a canoe underwater and slowly walking along the sandy floor to the underwater cave. The canoe trapped the air well enough to allow them to breathe. It was mad, but genius. Like a lot of Jack&#x27;s plans. He mused. It took a bit but they got there. Jo was right about the cave. The mouth of it was small enough to go unnoticed by others. It also appeared to hold an air pocket and Merlin was silently grateful that he wouldn’t have to keep breathing the same contained air as them. They quickly discarded their canoe once they could, putting it at the entrance so they could get back. Hundreds of crabs scattered as they walked. Merlin caressed the walls covered in runes and pictures depicting dragons in battle. He wanted to spend hours looking at them. The cave led to a tunnel that seemed endless. Until it wasn’t. It opened up to reveal a heavy stone door. The triskelion was carved in it. He tried pushing it but it wouldn’t budge. “It might need a key. Let’s look for a key hole or something like that.” As the dragonlord and lady looked around Jack leaned against the wall and pulled out some rum. “If we don&#x27;t have the key, we can&#x27;t open whatever part it unlocks. So what purpose would be served in finding whatever need be unlocked, which we don&#x27;t know, without first having found the key what unlocks it?” “What?” Merlin scrunched his face in confusion. “We don’t need a key.” “Now you’re not making sense.” “Found it” He interrupted. Je pointed to a small hole above the door that would’ve fit a relatively larger key. Merlin rolled his eyes at his uncle. “ Tospringe ” The stone shuddered and the door slowly moved inward. Dozens of arrows shot out at them. Merlin froze time for a second and pulled Jack down to the floor before continuing it. The arrows embedded themselves in the stone behind them and one in Jacks hat. The captain frowned at it before yanking it out. Behind the door was a dragon egg. They gasped. Merlin just about broke into tears then. He tiptoed to the egg. It was on a stand like Aithusas egg. This egg was dark grey but shimmered blue as he moved around it. He wished he could call Aithusa and let her witness this. So she could see the birth of a new age just as Kilgarrah had done with her. Merlin cleared his throat. “Could we wait to open this?” The pirate looked at him as if he had sprouted wings. “At least until we get up to land?” Jack shrugged. It was much easier retrieving the egg this time. Jack proudly brought out a jar of dirt and swapped the egg with it. He even drew a little smiley face on the jar. Merlin cradled it in his arms. He placed the egg into a bag and reversed the straps so it was nestled into his stomach. They made it out without any structures collapsing or any attacks. That’s if you don’t count crab pinches. The crew seemed fascinated by the egg but kept their space, if only for the protective look on Merlin&#x27;s face. They moved atop of the cliff, to where the rock ended and soft grasses started. Everyone waited as Merlin placed the egg on the ground and kneeled in front. His voice shifted as he yelled, “O drakon, e male so ftengometta tesd&#x27;hup&#x27;anankes !” Several of the crew looked at each other. They waited a minute before losing interest and leaving. Merlin sat there for nearly an hour. He was in a meditative trance. Anyone who tried to talk to him was ignored. The crew was ready to leave but they couldn’t without Merlin and more importantly, the egg. Then thunder sounded. Only there were clear skies. A white figure flew through the sky and landed with a large thud, a few feet away from Merlin. The warlock in a second was hugging the dragon. “Aithusa you made it!” He spoke in the same voice as you would a small child as he pet her scales. “I’m so sorry I used the voice with you but I didn&#x27;t know any other way to call you from this distance.” Aithusa glared at him for a second then was preening in the affection. “Look! I’ve found you a sister! Or a brother… I’m not sure yet.” He looked deep in thought but snapped himself out of it. He grabbed Jo by the wrist and dragged her towards the dragon. Jo was shocked to say the least. Dragon eggs were one thing but dragons the size of her home were another. She thought Emrys was joking but then again he was Emrys. She had never laid eyes on a dragon, only seen the drawing and heard the tales. Aithusa was magnificent. Her white scales make her glow like the sun, her size despite being the equivalent to a toddler was gigantic compared to humans. “This is Jo! She’s like me! She’s going to help me find more eggs so you won’t be alone anymore. I know how Killi can get. Especially with me leaving.” Aithusa chirped. He looked at her fondly before patting her neck. “I know.” “Let’s get this started shall we?” Merlin glanced at them, a mischievous grin on his face. He held the egg in front of him, he closed his eyes. “ Saiwalo ” the dragonlord whispered. Cracks started to form in the shell until a dark blue head popped out. Merlin chuckled at the irritated noise coming from the dragon, tears already falling. Saiwalo fully emerged and flung himself into Merlin&#x27;s arms. “The soul of the ocean” Jo translated. Merlin nodded. Neither could take their eyes off the baby dragon. “He’s blue too. It’s a good thing. It represents a time of prosperity” Merlin looked fondly at Saiwalo as he hiccuped flames into the grass. ~&lt;&gt;~ That night the Black Pearl broke out the rum and everyone got drunk. Merlin left Saiwalo with Aithusa once he fell asleep and joined in the festivities. He could hear the chorus of a dozen terrible singers. “I&#x27;ll eat when I&#x27;m hungry, I&#x27;ll drink when I&#x27;m dry If the hard times don&#x27;t kill me, I&#x27;ll lay down and di I&#x27;ll tune up my fiddle and I &#x27;ll rosin my bow I&#x27;ll make myself welcome, wherever I go!” Merlin joined in where he could but it didn’t seem to matter if anyone knew the lyrics or not. Half of them were unconscious and the their half couldn’t decide whether it was ‘I’ll eat when I’m hungry’ or ‘ I’ll drink when I’m hungry’. He ate some warm biscuits thanks to the fire and at some point danced several rounds with both Turner and Jo. He was drunk when he found himself wandering into the Captains Quarters. He barely remembered writing a letter or even giving it to Aithusa before she left. He didn’t remember falling asleep on the grass immediately after, with a baby dragon nestled into his jacket.

Their weekends consist of quoting Shakespeare, cooking in odd outfits, and being oblivious of each other&#x27;s past, even though it&#x27;s been right in front of them for a year. Notes This is a (late) birthday gift for Guilia ! I hope you had a wonderful birthday and have a wonderful year &lt;3 This was also an excuse for me to quote more Shakespeare than is usually acceptable. I just really love Shakespeare, okay? The plays I borrowed quotations from were Hamlet, Macbeth, Tempest, Richard III, Julius Cesar, Twelfth Night, and King Lear. Not necessarily in that order. Merlin was tapping away on his keyboard when he felt a pair of lips press on the top of his head. He grunted noncommittally hoping the distraction would go away, but of course, it did not. An arm wrapped underneath his own and around his chest as he felt a nose nudging along his hairline ending with soft breaths in his ear. “Come to bed,” the voice softly said, “It’s almost two.” “Yeah,” Merlin replied absently. He had to finish this paragraph, the words weren’t right. The arms swivelled his chair around and Merlin was torn from his writing to be met by the face of his boyfriend, Arthur. “Don’t make me go to bed alone,” Arthur asked, giving him his best puppy-dog eyes, “It’s hard to sleep without you.” “Misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows,” Merlin sighed, standing up. “No one has used the word bedfellows like that in years,” Arthur commented, dragging his reluctant partner back to their room, “And if you’re quoting Shakespeare at this time, you really need sleep.” Merlin gave him a pointed look. “I always quote Shakespeare. The man’s a genius. I’m surprised you got that one though, it’s not one of those plastered everywhere with its meaning messed up.” Arthur looked affronted as he wrestled Merlin’s limbs into a comfortable position before laying down next to him. “I do know a thing or two. You’ve even praised my knowledge of Shakespeare!” Merlin chucked. “But when I tell him he hates flatterers, he says he does, being most flattered.” “Go to sleep, idiot,” Arthur said affectionately, and soon enough, they did. ***** Merlin rolled over in his sleep, reluctant to be dragged out once more. When he reached out and felt the cold spot next to him he groaned and opened his eyes. “What the hell are you wearing?!” He yelled, eying Arthur wearily. Arthur was wearing Merlin’s writer shirt from uni (which was too small), paired with an apron tied around his waist instead of pants or trousers. Merlin could see the ends of the words ‘kiss the cook’ between the folds near his waist. “Do you like it?” Arthur asked, jutting his hip out and holding a tray like a waitress. “Thou dost infect mine eyes,” was all Merlin said, watching amused as Arthur shuffled towards him. Arthur rolled his eyes. “I made breakfast. I put on the first shirt I could find and made it to the kitchen before realizing I forgot pants. I didn’t want to wake you up so I just tied your apron around my waist for decency,” he explained. Merlin laughed but allowed him to sit next to him and inspected the breakfast. “Nothing burned, I’m impressed.” The two of them shared a look and started eating the surprisingly good meal. As they ate, Merlin studied Arthur. They had been together for almost a year now, yet they had pretty much kept to themselves. Merlin knew Arthur’s sister, Morgana, but that was mostly on her insistence and not his. Neither of them had met anyone from the other’s work, and they had met through friends so there were few introductions there. Arthur was handsome, Merlin knew that, all blonde and muscled. Arthur hated that description and claimed Merlin could do better, as a writer, but he would just laugh it off. He hadn’t met anyone, other than Will who was a special case, who didn’t like Arthur. It was time. “You’re doing the thing again,” Arthur said, waving his fork in Merlin’s face, “Spit it out.” “Will you come to the company party with me next weekend? It’s for the writers and publishers both so you may know someone” Merlin asked, but quickly went back to his food to avoid a reaction. “Hey,” Arthur whispered, tilting Merlin’s face up, “Of course.” Merlin beamed. “Great!” he exclaimed, putting the dishes on a tray, “It’s dressy so you would’ve needed to help anyway.” They both started laughing when Arthur’s mobile went off. “Morgana,” he said, “Something wicked this way comes.” He answered the call and turned it to speaker. “Hello, witch,” he greeted. “I prefer the term high priestess,” Morgana replied coldly, annoyance oozing out of her tone, “And I’ve not done anything mean to you in ages.” “One may smile, and smile, and be a villain,” Merlin offered, sipping his tea. “Good morrow to you too Shakespeare 2.0,” Morgana said, and then sighed. “As much as I’d love to catch up with you two, I’m calling about daddy dearest.” Arthur tensed beside him. “What about him?” “He wants you to attend some function next weekend,” Morgana replied, “Though it sounds awfully boring so I declined.” “Tell him I can’t make it, I’m going to something with Merlin.” Arthur answered, wrapping an arm around Merlin protectively, as if his father would somehow crawl out of the phone and take him away. “I’ll meet him some other time.” Morgana hummed. “Fine, but since I’m going to hear about it, you’re coming to my dinner party on Wednesday.” “What?” Arthur squawked “I didn’t agree to that!” “You’re going,” Morgana stated, “And you’re wearing that suit you bought for Viv and Mithian’s wedding, it’s delightful. And get Merlin to make that lovely pastry dessert for you to bring so you don’t come empty handed…” She went on with instructions as Arthur rubbed his face and groaned. “Can you save me?” he whispered to Merlin. Merlin chuckled and kissed just behind Arthur’s ear. “Sorry love, I don’t want to get on Morgana’s bad side. Dispute not with her: she is a lunatic.” “I heard that Gonzalo,” Morgana retorted, “You’re lucky you’re adorable. See you soon.” And with that she hung up. ***** The week went by in a blur. Merlin finished another chapter of his novel, and Arthur was finishing up his classes for his PhD. All too soon for Merlin’s liking, he was in a suit and on his way to the company party. He was shaking his leg and looking out the window nervously when Arthur leaned over, and whispered in his ear. “Be not afraid of greatness. Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them,” he said, and Merlin snorted. “Arthur that’s a dick joke.” Merlin abomished, and Arthur shrugged. Merlin huffed and looked out the window, although he was less nervous now. He really was lucky to have a boyfriend willing to quote old dick jokes to make him feel better. Too soon they pulled up in front of the posh hotel that the event was being held in. “Hell is empty and all the devils are here,” Merlin breathed, took Arthur’s hand in his, and together they faced the party. Arthur was the one that forced most of the socializing, but it was easier for Merlin because he had him at his side. They made it through most of the room before Merlin spotted Him. Not any old man - Him. He was the head publisher; if He published one of your books, it was almost guaranteed to be a bestseller. Merlin grabbed Arthur’s hand and pulled him across the room. “What -” Arthur sputtered but Merlin interrupted him. “It’s Him. Capital H. I can’t talk to him, I’ll make a fool out of myself. We need to go,” Merlin explained quickly, pulling Arthur towards the exit. They hadn’t made it five steps before they were stopped by someone calling Arthur’s name. They turned around and saw Him walking towards them. “Father?” Arthur asked, surprised, as the man approached. “Morgana said you were not going to make it,” He said, and then looked over at Merlin. “Who’s this?” “This is my boyfriend Merlin,” Arthur replied, “Merlin, this is my father, Uther. I didn’t know he was a publisher here.” “Neither did I,” Merlin sheepishly admitted, “It’s a pleasure to meet you sir.” Uther just looked at him critically. “How did you two meet?” he asked. “Well…” Merlin stalled, thinking about how they actually met. He was shirtless in the park with a painting of Ariel on his chest frantically yelling about the values of Shakespeare while shoving flyers in the faces of innocent passersby when Arthur had come up and said ‘Your tale good sir, could cure deafness’, and after that was a string of failed coffee dates… but he couldn’t tell his boss that. “You know…” Merlin tried again, wishing Arthur was helping him and not laughing at him, the clotpole. “Journeys end in lovers meeting,” he ended helplessly. “Twelfth Night,” Uther commented. Then he nodded, and walked away. Arthur and Merlin exchanged looks then burst out laughing. “Your face,” Arthur laughed, doubling over, “I could tell you didn’t want to tell him about how we met!” “I wasn’t the one who pulled Two Noble Kinsmen out of my ass,” Merlin replied, still laughing. “Yeah but you were the one with a wind spirit painted on your chest,” Arthur countered. The two of them continued laughing for so long that many other guests gave them odd stares, pointed, and whispered. When they finally pulled themselves together, Merlin pulled Arthur close. “Beyond all manner of so much, I love you,” Merlin whispered, leaning forward so their foreheads were touching. “King Lear,” Arthur replied, smiling lightly, “Love, and be silent.” They kissed slowly, moving their lips together in perfect harmony. They broke apart and looked at each other happily for a few moments. “Let’s have a happier ending,” Merlin suggested lightly, pulling out of the embrace and walking Arthur back out of the building. Arthur hugged him from behind and Merlin tried to hail a taxi. “Yeah,” he breathed onto Merlin’s neck, “Let’s.”</span> <a href="#" class="summary-toggle">[ + ]</a></div><div class="stats"><div class="stat-item"><strong>Rating:</strong> Teen And Up Audiences</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Archive Warning:</strong> No Archive Warnings Apply</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Category:</strong> M/M</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Fandom:</strong> Merlin (TV)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Relationship:</strong> Merlin/Arthur Pendragon (Merlin), Merlin/Arthur Pendragon</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Character:</strong> Merlin (Merlin), Arthur Pendragon (Merlin), Morgana (Merlin), Uther Pendragon (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Additional Tags:</strong> Established Relationship, Alternate Universe - Modern Setting, Domestic Fluff</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Published:</strong> 2015-04-14</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Words:</strong> 1608</div></div></div><div class="work-entry"><h2 class="title"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://download.archiveofourown.org/downloads/24423010/When%20youre%20in%20love%20You.pdf?updated_at=1607069454" target="_blank">When you&#x27;re in love...

Notes Okay so Hiii!!. This is my first ever time writing a fanfiction and I thought merthur would be great choice. First of all thank you for actually still being here, i really hope you enjoy this and second of all, i got the idea to write through an AMAZING POST ON INSTAGRAM by @auctionoffmysoul.

Also A HUGE HUGE THANK YOU to &#x27;wantyourbadromance&#x27; (this is her ao3) for this absolutely amazing summary. If you like drarry ( Draco Malfoy X Harry Potter ) , you should totally follow her insatagram account @drarry.darling . See the end of the work for more notes Every morning since merlin had the misfortune to become the manservant of the arrogant prat, he has to wake up early, get that clotpole’s breakfast and wake him up. &quot;That lazy idiot&quot; merlin thinks outloud. It’s never him who gets to rest. No matter what happens and how badly merlin is hurt and in pain he has to wake up and get Arthur ready. He’s used to it. He has to accept it. There’s no way out, since apparently pRoTEctINg aRtHUr iS hIS dEstINy and he can do nothing about it. It’s not like waking him up and hearing Arthur&#x27;s scarthy and deep morning voice sends shivers down his spine or when he takes the sheets off and leaves Arthur exposed waist up and no matter how many times he does it, his heartbeat gets insanely fast and he’s not sure if it’s healthy. Caring and protecting for Arthur has become a part of his life. Extremely diotic to say, Arthur has become his life. Waking him up, getting him ready, going to training with him, polishing his armor, getting him his food, listening to his constant ramble about how Uther is a tyrant, leaving him to his room at night and the same routine over again. He would never dare say it aloud but he would be more than happy sticking with this routine for the rest of his life than changing anything,but a question that always surfaces his mind at nights is would Arthur want it? Would he ever get tired of Merlin? Would he wake up one day and wish to remove merlin of his duties? Merlin hopes, scratch that actually yearns that Arthur would never get tired of him and get rid of him. Merlin wouldn’t know what to do with himself if that happened. That thought of not seeing Arthur everyday pains him more than any burn, scar or stab. It is simply and excrutuatingly brutal So when merlin gets horribly wounded by a meddling goon of Saxons while fighting and tryingt to save Arthur&#x27;s life (again) he couldn’t even move. Those fuckers really did up their game this time. As he laid down on his bed at the break of dawn, he highly doubted that he would be able to get up early to wake Arthur and he didn’t want that. He did not not want to be the first person Arthur sees in the morning but the scars ran deep and the blood was barely contained by his bandages. Throwing a new shirt over ,he thinks of staying up but he was in horrible pain and before he knew he went off to sleep thinking of how pissed off Arthur would be in the morning if his manservant didn’t wake him up and have his armor polished and ready. Well and that happened, he didn’t wake up himself and he doesn&#x27;t wake up Arthur and when the prince wakes up the first thing he’s met with is an empty cold room with the curtains drawn and no breakfast. NO BREAKFAST. He always knew merlin liked to keep him on a diet but entirely skipping his meal ? that’s atrocious, unacceptable. Arthur would not tolerate this. &quot;Merlin? Merlin, you git. Where are you?&quot;. “Merlin? this is not amusing on any level. Stop playing and come out. “ Utter silence. “Are you hiding in the closet? Get out of it, this instant Merlin” “Meeeeeeeerrrliiiiiiiinnn” “Merlin” he grits out. “Come out of wherever you are hiding before I have you thrown in the dungeons” No use. He’s met with silence as the only sound except for his ragged breathing. Arthur is confused. Very confused. It’s very late and merlin is never late, he should have been here ages ago. He was mad alright. He couldn’t help but wonder if this was an exaggerated prank or something genuinly had happened to merlin. He had to fetch his clothes and GET READY HIMSELF. The cruelty endured by Arthur , nbelievable. So he gets up, goes to Gaius only to be told merlin is really sick and tired. Of course the gay panic starts to show and he hurries off to merlin’s room only to find him sweating heavily and shivering. He takes a quick glance around the room and observes its messy condition. He ponders on waking him up but decides against it, thinking his man servant deserves a rest. So Prince Arthur yes, the prince himself. Gets breakfast for merlin in the kitchen leaving everyone with their Jaws hanging on the floor, literally. Doesn&#x27;t tell the knights or Gwen or Morgana, since he wants his time alone with merlin. He knows if they come along he won&#x27;t be able to take care properly and he wanted to be the their when merlin wakes up, just like merlin is there for Arthur every morning. He sets the breakfast on the table, takes the sheets off merlin and wipes the sweat of his forehead. Minutes pass with Arthur just admiring merlin, truly he is a beauty and Arthur is really tempted to pass his hair through those raven locks but doesn&#x27;t know why he wants to do that. Is it because he cares for merlin? As a friend? No that&#x27;s not possible, he&#x27;s a prince and merlin is well, an idiotic man servant. Well a brave man servant actually, but still idiotic. Funny thing is Arthur&#x27;s mind is focused on merlin being an idiot as the reason why they aren&#x27;t friends, it didn&#x27;t focus on the class difference. His subconscious let it be, he didn&#x27;t want to overthink, at least not this time, not with merlin by his side. He&#x27;ll sort his feelings out. He&#x27;s lost in his mental war of does he consider merlin as a friend when suddenly merlin jerks in his sleep and writhers, Arthur panicking gets up to call Gaius but remembers, he&#x27;s gone to a nearby village for some ingredients. He doesn&#x27;t know what to do. He never paid attention to whatever Gaius had told him about health or sickness. He picks up the towel he brought with him, wets in and wipes the sweat off merlin’s forehead and face with it. Merlin does jerk at the contact but soon relaxes into the rough but caring touch. Arthur really needs to work on self-control since his hand, apparently has a mind of its own and makes its way to merlin’s hair, settling there. He feels the dampness, the sweat, the droplets of water, but that doesn&#x27;t faze him. He isn&#x27;t disgusted, he actually has a grin forming on his face, his shoulders relaxing. His hand stays there for a moment while he questions if he should comb merlin’s hair. He would need to have a great explanation if someone walked in, or worse merlin woke up, but that hair is just so tempting. At the end consequences be dammed Arthur thinks, he&#x27;s the prince of Camelot, he doesn&#x27;t need to answer to the likes of others. Well except merlin for some apparent reason. So, he starts with feather light touches at first, just barely moving and grazing his hair. The ease in merlin’s breathing doesn&#x27;t go unnoticed by Arthur and he takes it as a hint to get bolder, so he does. He makes full stokes now. No longer petting. He&#x27;s admiring more than combing actually. How his hair frames his head, and how it is in stark comparison to his pale skin. He lets his gaze wonder beneath to see merlin’s face. that was a mistake, seriously that was a mistake. Arthur thinks of himself as a mistake but this is the biggest mistake he&#x27;s ever made. Merlin looked ethereal. His eyelashes fanning over his closed eyes and his high cheekbones contouring his face. His cheeks were pale, too pale but his lips. They were soft and thin and inviting. It was horrible to have a such a temptation be dangled in front of him and he couldn&#x27;t relish it, after all what excuse would he give to merlin as to why he was pressing his lips to merlin’s and had one hand petting his hair. Nope. No matter how tempted he was, he would absolutely not be kissing merlin. He&#x27;s merlin. Why would Arthur ever want to kiss him? Never in a million years would he want to…. Why would he- Oh well never mind, question answered, because merlin just happened to groan a little in his not so deep slumber and Arthur swore if he weren&#x27;t prince of Camelot he would have merlin here and now. But he&#x27;s the prince, that would never be acceptable. Only if he weren’t the prince Arthur thinks. Merlin started to stir again as the combing of hair stopped and his hand was trembling. Slightly, but trembling. Almost as if on impulse his free hand went to grab merlin’s but he was quick to retreat it. He couldn&#x27;t. He just couldn&#x27;t. Why? Because he was a prince. Of course that&#x27;s what he thought but something inside of him spoke up &#x27;you&#x27;re a coward who&#x27;s afraid to admit his feelings Arthur&#x27; . That was not true, at all. That&#x27;s really not, how could he, I mean there&#x27;s no absolute way he, never in billion years would Arthur. That is insane, absolutely insane, no there is no way that he could… he could. Like merlin. They’re juts friends, that’s it, he can’t like merli- oh to hell with is Arthur thought. If he wants to confess and get it off his chest he can do it now, when merlin is asleep and he doesn’t embarrass himself. &quot;I like you okay? I have for a long time and... And I don&#x27;t know what to do and in the name of Camelot I absolutely despise you merlin, why do you have to be such an idiot- “ His nonstop rambling was interrupted by a shift in merlin’s movement. Arthur&#x27;s breath hitched. He&#x27;s dead, yep he&#x27;s dead. Oh he&#x27;s so dead. Might as well leave and escape Camelot. He&#x27;s Doomed, leave build a farm have horses and, never look back. Have kids and sweet lord, his train of thoughts approached a halt as merlin shifted again on the bed and laid with his back to Arthur. He was on his side, and Arthur&#x27;s hand form his hair fell. He missed it. Missed the soft and damp feeling of merlin’s velvety hair. He wanted desperately to feel it again but he was scared. He admitted he was. What would he say to merlin? Oh, hi merlin I just thought that I would stop by with breakfast and comb your hair and stare at you lovingly while I think of how beautiful you are? Well fuck it the pendragon argued with himself, he got up, put one knee on the bed and peered over merlin to watch if he&#x27;s awake, which he was thankfully not, and climbed fully into bed with him. Now you see the bed was small and he really had to get close to merlin in order for them to not fall off and get hurt, and of course that was the sole reason he thought of cuddling with merlin and not totally because of how desperately he wanted physical contact with the man who had been his shameless day dreaming material (that’s a story for another time). With every last ounce of courage left within him and a prayer to the gods above he laid down and snaked his right arm underneath merlin’s slim torso pulling him closer and placed his other hand again in merlin’s hair combing it. They were in bed. Together. Merlin and Arthur, in bed, in merlin’s bed. They were cuddling, in merlin’s bed. Together. Prince Arthur of Camelot was cuddling his sick man servant merlin in his bed. &quot;oh fuck me” Arthur groaned, he&#x27;s so dead its literally not even funny now. He was worried, he thought of leaving, leaving and pretending nothing ever happened and just continue with their lives and hide his pathetic crush and take it to his grave but Of course merlin is an idiot and he just had to press into Arthur&#x27;s touch. He had to arch his back and he had to mewl softly. He just had to question Arthur and upstage him. He always had to challenge and frankly that’s what turned him on. The sheer audacity of a servant boy to challenge the prince himself. Well Arthur never turned down from a challenge and in heat of the moment, with merlin’s slightly erotic movements, he tugged him closer, threw his left leg to entrap both of marlins and hooked his chin on merlin’s shoulder. He thought he&#x27;d leave after a while to sort things out you know. He&#x27;d leave after he&#x27;s satisfied but truth be told he&#x27;s never satisfied, no matter how much time he spends with Merlin he&#x27;s left wanting more and more and it&#x27;s slowly killing him that merlin may never be his. He’s a soon to be king, he has duties, he can’t marry out of his heart. He would sadly have to bind in a political union he never wished to have. He can’t spend the rest of his life with someone who wasn’t his life. Merlin was Arthur’s entire existence at this point. That’s what Arthur thinks at times. Maybe, just maybe and oh god Arthur hopes it’s not true otherwise he would kill himself. Maybe merlin and Arthur were just meant to meet and not meant to be. With his mind fogged he moves to get up and sprint and hide away. So he doesn&#x27;t have to face his fears, so merlin never knows and Arthur stays delusional, so he doesn’t have to get his heartbroken. He can&#x27;t. He can&#x27;t say what he wants and ruin what they have. He can&#x27;t. With a frustrated sigh he moves to leave but merlin, oh Of course merlin has to do something, has to go neck to neck with him. Merlin shifts suddenly, completely changing his position and lunging into Arthur&#x27;s arms throwing his own over Arthur&#x27;s neck and pressing them chest to chest. Arthur&#x27;s sure he forgets to breath. How does one breathe ? Exhale, inhale right? He&#x27;s very sure he&#x27;s going to mess this up but merlin, merlin looked so beautiful in his arms. He thought if angels existed this is what they would look like. He wished to keep him forever. No matter how short their forever is supposed to be. He exhales deeply, gathers up every last bit of courage he has because well, fake it till you make it right? and resumes his previous position, his right hand combing merlin’s hair and left clinging to his thin waist. He buries his nose in the curve of his clothed shoulder and he can feel a shudder from underneath him but passes it off as merlin being merlin. He stays there. Feeling blissful, feeling for in a long time happy and content. That’s what merlin does to him. Makes him feel as if Arthur is enough but at the same time challenges him to be better, less arrogant, more caring, less inconsiderate, more open minded and loving. “oh merlin, only if you knew” He breathes out and hugs him impossibly tighter and thinks, thinks of how his life has changed due to merlin. How he wakes to his grin and goes off to sleep to his smile. How, merlin is with him no matter what and how he has been ready to sacrifice himself again and again for Arthur, for Camelot. Merlin forcefully broke down his walls and slithered in, encasing Arthur. He makes him feel human. He makes Arthur feel wanted, not just for kingly business but for who he is and for he should be. Well for him Arthur was never a prince. He was just another person. That&#x27;s what Arthur liked the most. How he didn&#x27;t have to worry about titles and class and standards with merlin. For once he could be himself. He could be who he was and merlin would never judge. Merlin, would always help him grow and merlin would be there any hour of the day to comfort Arthur and that is not solely because of his duty as his manservant. Merlin has always considered him as a friend but Arthur is git and he pushed him away because knew, he knew that if they became friends he wouldn’t be able to stop those feelings rising in his heart, he couldn’t keep it platonic and he would ruin their bond. Arthur couldn’t lose merlin, he just didn’t want him, he needed him. He depended on him because if there would be no merlin, there would be no Arthur and Arthur hoped that merlin thought the same. That without Arthur, there would be no merlin. Merlin would always, always be with him. That&#x27;s what he desired. To have merlin by his side and be by his forever. To be together. He smiled, a genuine small smile and pressed a light peck to merlin’s hair. Merlin. That&#x27;s all he ever wishes for now. He thinks, it would be worth it. It would be truly worth it. To wake up, with merlin in his arms and his confused eyes and for once be on the sending end of the goofy grin. He chuckles, puts his chin on his shoulder and drifts off to sleep, knowing no matter what happens, they will be together. End Notes Once again thank you so much for reading this.

Arthur is surprised to find himself kissing his manservant. Notes See the end of the work for notes --- ღ --- Arthur has asked Merlin to polish his armour. He has to polish every piece that makes its way over Arthur’s right arm and chest. He’s plopped on the floor sitting cross legged in the middle of Arthur’s chambers. He really shouldn’t be using the prince’s floor as his workspace but Arthurs off at a knighting ceremony or something and Merlin plans to have it done before he gets back. He smiles as he places down the now clean piece and looks over at what’s still dirty with a frown. The door to Arthur’s chambers bursts opens and Arthur strolls in. Merlin jumps, startled from the loud noise. “Merlin are you seriously polishing my armour in my chambers?” He whines. “Well yes, but- I.” Arthur sighs and strolls to his wardrobe. “I was coming here to go to bed but I don’t suppose I’m going to get much sleep with that ratchet your making.” Just as Arthur says that Merlin drops a piece of Arthurs armour as it slips out of his hands as he scrubbed it. It clangs harshly against the cool palace floor. Arthur just sighs and kicks his boots off throwing them in one corner of the room without much care, Merlin watches noting that he’ll have to put them away later. “Sorry, I’ll take this to Gaius’ place so you can sleep.” “No its fine you’re almost done anyway, right?” Merlin looks to the pile of unpolished armour, it’s a lot larger than the pile of polished armour he notices. Arthur’s eyes follow Merlins and he sighs once again. “You really are a horrible manservant.” Merlin casts his eyes downward slightly ashamed. “I should have done a spell” He whispers. “What?” “Nothing, I’ll pick up the pace.” “Ugh let me help, if I want to ever get to sleep tonight.” Merlin starts to laugh. “You&#x27;re going to help your servant polish your armour? Doesn’t that defeat the whole purpose of having me around?” Merlin laughs amused. “I mean have you ever polished anything in your life? I don’t want you to get blisters.” Merlin coughs face turning serious when he sees the glare Arthurs gives him. “Uh- Sire.” Arthur doesn’t say anything just rolls his eyes and quietly walks over to sit on the floor across from Merlin their knees brushing together for a second. Merlin continues rubbing the armour with his rag in attempt to get all the dirt off the metal piece and have it shining again. There are no short cuts just hard work to make everything shine again, unless you use magic of course. “Well it doesn’t look that hard you just wipe it. If you can do it surely I can.” Merlin ignores the prince and continues scrubbing. Arthur snatches the rag and piece out of his hands. “You take too long, look.” Arthurs gives one scrub to the front and one to the back before throwing the metal piece into the polished pile, it lands with an obnoxious noise. “No you didn’t do it right.” Merlin mumbles “What do you mean? It’s fine.” Arthur insists. Merlin picks up the piece, inspecting it. “See you have to scrub harder it’s still dirty, it needs to shine. If I did a job like this you would have fired me a long time ago.” Merlin laughs. “Oh I’ve thought about it trust me.” Arthur replies, Merlin gulps. “Let me see.” Arthur insists hand making a motion towards himself. Arthur leans his head down to look closely as the piece of armour in Merlins hands, placing the rag down. “Huh.” “I know it’s a servant’s job and all but that doesn’t make it easy.” Merlin almost whispers. Their faces are only inches apart looking at the goddamn piece of metal that would have been polished by now if Arthur didn’t have to be such a twat. “You’re right, maybe I don’t give you enough credit.” Arthur mumbles so quiet Merlin doesn’t almost hear him. “Ha! Did I hear that right?” Merlin chuckles. “Oh shut up Merlin, or I will fire you and hire someone who complains less.” “Right.” Merlin avoids his gaze and picks ups the rag, scrubbing the armour once again. He can still feel Arthur’s eyes on him, now watching the servant’s hands. Merlin gulps. The prince still has his face awfully close to Merlins watching him work. After what seems like ages he’s finished that piece and smiles at his work, placing it in the polished pile. Merlin looks up the see Arthur gaze still on him. “Look I’ll take this home and have it ready by morning you need your rest.” Merlin gets up on his knees reaching for the bag he keeps the princes armour in. “No! Merlin wait.” Arthur booms. Merlin as clumsy as he is , becomes startled and somehow falls forward onto the prince knocking him downward and pinning him down. “Merlin you idiot, get off me!” Arthur shoves the boy off him and sits up. “Honestly Merlin how do you even manage to get out of bed in the morning, without breaking a leg?” “My apologies sire, but why can’t I leave.” Arthur eyes his servant for a second before he does the unthinkable. Arthur lurches forward crashing his lips against Merlin’s for less than a second before pulling away and standing up, almost jumping back a metre. “Uh no you can leave you’re done for the day.” Merlin looks up at his master, stunned. He shakes his head and comes back to reality questioning whether it even happened or whether his affection for Arthur had started causing him to lose his sanity. However the way his lips tingle slightly means it must have happened. “Ok I’ll just pack this up so I can take it-“ “No its fine you can do it tomorrow, just leave.” “Um ok I guess I get you ready for bed then.” “Yes, get up.” Merlin stands going through his usual night routine, shaking slighting and trying to ignore the obvious awkward tension that is spreading through the room in thick suffocating waves. He picks up Arthurs boots and places them in their spot. He then open the covers to Arthur’s bed allowing him to be able to slip in when he’s ready. Arthur removes his shirt and thrusts it at Merlin chest. Merlin is pushed back a bit but manages to grab the shirt and places it in the washing basket which is almost full, Merlin will have to wash tomorrow he thinks. Arthur climbs into bed with a red face and clenched fists, turning away from Merlin. “Night sire.” Merlin gulps covering the last candle still burning in the room, the absence of oxygen causes the flame to die. Not expecting a reply he creeps out of the princes chambers, closing the door quietly behind him. Arthur turns to lie on his back, starting up and questioning why the hell he had done that. Merlin drives him utterly insane, however he knew that he had developed feelings for the boy somehow. Why else would he have kept him around? He’s horrible at being a servant and has gotten himself and Arthur in trouble plenty of times. However he didn’t have to act on these feelings and now who knows what will happen. Merlin may tell his father or the people, or worse Merlin may retire as Arthur’s manservant. There’s just something about Merlin that Arthur is drawn too, like an imaginable tie, pulling them together no matter how hard Arthur tries to pull away. God the look on his face made Arthur feel like a monster. “You really screwed up this time Arthur.” He mumbles to himself, preparing a long night with little sleep and thinking of possible candidates for a new manservant. Not too far away from the prince a young warlock lays in his bed wondering what on earth possessed the future king to kiss him but feeling hopeful, maybe Arthur loved him, maybe just maybe the prince loved Merlin as Merlin loved the prince. --- ღ --- The next morning Merlin enters Arthur’s room carrying the prince’s breakfast. Merlin didn’t get much sleep last night. Excitement pumped through his veins until the early hours of the morning when his mind finally stopped racing with thoughts of Arthur kissing and his body finally decided it was time to sleep. Arthur didn’t sleep much last night either however it was not excitement that kept him awake, rather it was fear. When Merlin enters the prince’s room he see Arthur is awake, surprisingly and even sitting up in his bed, starting at the wall. “Morning sire.” Arthur looks over to Merlin. “About time I’m starving.” Merlin has a big grin on his face, waiting for Arthur to mention something about last night or even kiss him again. “Well what are you standing there for? And what on earth are you grinning at?” Merlin is shaken out of his thoughts and brings the prince’s breakfast to him. “Arthur?” “Hmmm.” Arthur asks taking a bite of the bread Merlin bought him. “Can I ask you something?” “You just did?” “Huh right well something else.” “Yes Merlin, out with it.” “Why exactly did you kiss me last night?” Arthur coughs choking on his food a little. “Alright Merlin I have some chores for you to do today first I’ll need you to get me some sup-“ That’s when Merlin stops listening. It was a mistake, Arthur thought it was a mistake. It makes sense. It only lasted for a second and it was messy, a messy mistake. --- ღ --- Before lunchtime but after Arthur’s morning training with the knights. Merlin enters Arthur’s chambers to see him packing. “Ah Merlin, did you get everything?” “What?” “I asked you to get me supplies today, remember?” “Supplies? For what?” “I told you this morning I’ve decided to go hunting this afternoon.” “What why?” “Honestly Merlin did you even hear I word I said this morning? What have you been doing all this time?” “I-I finished polishing your armour.” Merlin holds out the bag off now polished armour sheepishly. “And I did you’re laundry.” “Well now I’m not going to be able to set out straight after lunch as planned.” Merlin looks at the prince shocked. This passive aggressiveness is getting ridiculous and now Arthur just wants to go hunting to get away from him? “I’m sorry okay! I’m sorry I’m and horrible servant, I’m sorry you kissed me by mistake and I’m sorry I love you!” Merlins face changes from anger to shock knowing his is going to cope it now. He may even be sent to the King to explain himself. Arthurs sighs. “Is that what you think? That I kissed you by mistake?” Merlin shrugs. Arthur takes a few steps forward standing right in front of his servant. “Look Merlin I don’t know why I kissed you. I mean I do, it’s because I wanted to, and I have these feelings that I don’t understand and I guess I just acted on them-.” Merlin looks down and Arthur raises his hand and places in on the side of Merlin’s face, stroking his thumb along Merlins cheek. “Can I kiss you, again?” Arthurs whispers. Merlin looks up, eyes blown wide and cheeks flushed. He nods his head and Arthur leans in, gently placing his lips on the other boy. This kiss is completely different to the one from last night. Last night was tight unsuspecting lips banging together but this, this is lips gently touching, and tongues lightly poking into the others mouth, hands finding bony hips, bony hands finding handfuls of blonde hair to grasp, pressing against one another. They pull away, all too soon it seems. “This is worse than when I had a crush on Gwen.” “Well that’s because you didn’t kiss her.” “Well actually I did.” “Oh really?” “Yeah, but at least she was a woman how the hell can I tell my father I love my manservant.” “Love?” “You said it first.” “It’s true, I do love you Arthur Pendragon.” “And I you.” “Do you really have to go hunting?” “No, I was only going to avoid you.” “I figured.” “I was worried you hated me.” “I wish I hated you.” “Oh shut it.” “So what now?” “Honestly I have no idea.” “Oh.” “No I mean I want us to be together, but we can’t while my father is still king.” “Who says he has to know?” Merlin asks with a grin. Arthur grins right back at him an array or perfect royal white teeth. “You would be happy to keep it a secret?” “You’d be surprised at how good I am at keeping secrets.” Merlin frowns. “Alright then it’s settled.” Arthur smiles sweetly and Merlin can’t help kissing him again. “You still have to be my manservant, it’ll be a good cover.” “I wouldn’t have it any other way.” “Good because I have some chores for you to do.” Merlin groans and Arthur grins. “I need you to make my bed.” “But I already made it, I made it this morning while you were getting dressed.” “Right.” Arthur ponders appearing to be in thought. He then breaks out into a grin and leans down grabbing Merlin under his butt and pulling him over his shoulder, starting to walk over to the bed. “Arthur what the- put me down!” “Merlin I’ve lifted swords heavier then you.” Arthur chuckles, reaching the bed and plopping Merlin down. “Well that’s a bit of an exaggeration.” Merlin’s frown is quickly gone as he finds Prince Arthur following him onto the bed and laying on top of him. “Now you’ll have to make the bed.” “Oh.” --- ღ --- End Notes This is my first time posting a fic so I hope it wasn&#x27;t too bad, maybe a little cheesy I&#x27;ll admit.

Notes For timeline purposes, this is in between season and season two. Merlin is nonbinary but uses any pronouns, mainly he/him. In later fics part of the series, people will use other pronouns on him. His explanation of being nonbinary does not necessarily fit the stereotypical idea of being nonbinary, which is purposeful to show the nonbinary is not one set definition, just like being trans isn&#x27;t one set definition. Arthur is ftm, but it&#x27;s never outright said. He binds with bandages, which is unsafe binding but it&#x27;s not like the binders we have today existed back then. The specifics of him being trans is never explained in the fic series, I&#x27;d rather explore that in a fic focusing on entirely him and him being trans. Okay, enough of my rambling. I hope you enjoy! See the end of the work for more notes It’s a normal hunting trip. Merlin is miserable, Arthur finds it funny, and there’s somehow very little game out to hunt. After about an hour, they find a rabbit, which Arthur kills easily with an arrow. It’s anticlimactic, but it’s normal. Arthur has never been one to necessarily enjoy everything being the same, but for today it’s okay. He throws the dead rabbit at Merlin, who barely catches it. Merlin looks down at it with disgust, as he always does. Today, he looks half tempted to put it down instead of carrying it like he’s meant to. He recoils into himself when he holds the rabbit in one hand. It’s one of the smaller rabbits Arthur has killed. “Stop being such a girl, Merlin,” Arthur says, which he’s said maybe a hundred times before. It’s routine at this point. “It’s just a rabbit.” “I’m not,” Merlin snaps as he looks at Arthur. “I’m not being a girl.” Arthur rolls his eyes. “Well, you’re not being a man either.” Merlin stands taller, wearing an expression Arthur can’t quite place. An expression filled with disgust but also anger but also sadness. It’s too many emotions at once, Arthur knows that much. “I’m not a man either,” Merlin says. Arthur looks around to catch eyes with a knight, see what they think of this, but they’re alone. The knights are back at their horses, getting ready to leave. Merlin looks ready to fight now that he’s said the words. “Then what are you?” Arthur asks, amusement in his voice, but he’s not amused. He’s unsure what he’s feeling, but his chest is tight, and it’s not from the bandages wrapped around it right now. “Neither.” Merlin grimaces when he moves enough that he remembers what he’s holding. “How can you be neither?” For a moment, he swears the bandages tighten, but he knows they haven’t. He knows they’re the same tightness they were when he put them on that morning. “You’re either a man or you’re a woman.” “But I’m not,” Merlin says before turning to walk toward the horses and the knights. He doesn’t look at Arthur when he speaks next. “Please remember that.” Arthur wants to say he will remember that—he’ll remember this entire conversation vividly, but he doesn’t know how to. Merlin walks off, and Arthur is left standing there confused. What does Merlin being neither mean? Arthur watches Merlin from across the table where Merlin is sharpening and polishing Arthur’s sword. It’s a bit mesmerizing, especially since Merlin now does it without needing constant help. Out of all his chores, this is the one he really excels at. Arthur hasn’t forgotten their conversation from last week. Part of him has tried to. It’d be easier on him if he did because he wouldn’t be thinking so much. Because Merlin looks like a man. He isn’t really feminine besides his hair growing out a little too long. Arthur’s father would scold him if he grew his hair out to be that long. Merlin’s shoulders aren’t broad like Arthur’s, but it’s because Arthur has had years of training and Merlin has had years of farming. Different muscle groups Arthur supposes. It&#x27;s been difficult to not bring it up. He wants to know if he and Merlin are the same, and if so, how does Merlin look so masculine while Arthur worries he doesn’t. What is the trick that he’s been missing all these years? “You’re staring,” Merlin says without looking at him. “Making sure you aren’t ruining my sword,” Arthur retorts, and Merlin tenses a little as he continues tending to Arthur’s sword. Arthur has known Merlin for long enough to know it’s not about his sword. Merlin is worried about what Arthur will say if they actually talk about the brief conversation last week. Silence looms over them, uncomfortably or at least for Arthur. Then Merlin takes a deep breath before letting it out slowly. “You’re allowed to ask questions,” Merlin says, still not looking at him. Arthur wants him to look at him. “I don’t mind answering.” “What did you mean by neither?” Arthur asks, and it feels stupid to since he’s already asked that. He’s confused, though. The option “neither” has never been one he’s seen before. Merlin finally looks at him. There’s some level of understanding in his expression, but there can’t be. There can’t be any level of understanding if Merlin is apparently neither and Arthur is a man. Those are so vastly different. So different that Arthur swallows any sort of hope so the eventual disappointment isn’t absolutely crushing. “I don’t feel like a man but I also don’t feel like a woman,” Merlin says as if it’s that simple. “I just feel like me, so neither. There’s no better way to explain it, I guess.” “But how did you know?” Arthur asks, desperation creeping into his voice. Merlin puts the sword down, giving Arthur all of his attention. “I just kind of knew? Didn’t really fit in with the other kids in Ealdor, but I didn’t mind much. My friend played with me no matter what we did. Playing in the woods, picking flowers, tried braiding his hair at one point and failed.” Merlin chuckles a little at that. “He told me I’m liking having a boy and girl friend at once.” Merlin pauses. “I’ve been seen as weird my entire life for lots of things, but he made me feel normal.” “So, someone else made you realize?” Arthur asks slowly. “No, I always knew.” Merlin chews on his lips a little, thinking. “Don’t really like being called ‘son’ but it doesn’t bother me. Like, I don’t mind it but I prefer being called child.” They were different. That hope Arthur had tried to swallow down now bubbles in his stomach, making it hurt and fear he’s going to vomit on the floor. He shouldn’t have hoped because there had been no reason. He’s still alone. “It’s a lot of I don’t mind but would prefer something else,” Merlin says. It still doesn’t make sense. Arthur figures it doesn’t have to entirely make sense. It’s not like he feels like who he is makes a lot of sense either. “What am I supposed to call you?” Arthur asks. It doesn’t have to make sense for him to respect Merlin. He doesn’t want Merlin to feel alone or uncomfortable when it comes to this. “What you’ve been calling me up until now has been fine.” Merlin pauses. “I don’t mind being called a girl, I just hate how you do it. It’s not an insult to me. It’s… it’s nice actually.” Arthur thinks of someone calling him a girl and has to swallow the bile creeping up his throat. Merlin looks away, face slightly flushed from embarrassment, and Arthur knows he’s shown his discomfort. He doesn’t know how to take it back or if he even can. Instead, he pretends he didn’t notice Merlin’s embarrassment. “So, I can still call you a man?” Arthur asks. “If that makes you the most comfortable,” Merlin says with a shrug. “As I’ve said, I don’t mind things but prefer other things. Just calling me a servant or person is fine.” “So, you’d like it if I call you my servant instead of manservant?” “Yes, but you can still call me your manservant if you want, sire.” Arthur slowly nods. It’s all a bit too much at once, but he refuses to show that. He refuses to show that he’s unsure what to do with all this information. Refuses to show that he needs to think and process. He knows he can’t do that with Merlin standing there with his head tilted to the side and an expectant look on his face. “Are you finished with my sword?” Merlin looks down at the forgotten sword on the table before looking back at him and nods. “Then go polish my armor.” Merlin nods, and Arthur hopes he understands. He just needs time to think. There’s no way to say that without looking weak, though. Merlin looks like he understands or maybe Arthur is forcing that hope onto him. “Of course, sire,” Merlin says, and he doesn’t sound annoyed. He sounds relieved. Maybe both of them need this conversation to end right now. Maybe they both need time to think. Arthur convinces himself it’s that. Merlin leaves Arthur’s chambers, and Arthur presses his back into the chair as he sighs. Merlin is neither a man nor a woman. He’s just himself. Arthur reminds himself it doesn’t have to make sense, but he desperately wishes it would. Maybe then he’ll find himself making more sense as well. End Notes I hope you enjoyed!

Notes title from: &quot;Waiting On You&quot; - Weezer based off this post: https://rainbowrabblerouser.tumblr.com/post/617952484515856384 See the end of the work for more notes When Arthur emerges from the lake, he’s pissed to find that he is not only alone, but soaking wet and his body hurts like a bitch. Also, no Merlin. No sword nor armor. “Merlin! Are you there?” No answer. This sucks. So Arthur attempts to get situated, but he nearly gets hit by what he assumed was a metal wagon that was somehow able to move without a horse. Where is he? Apparently some place called Europe. When he goes to some form of civilization, he asks for help, but the only people who help him are a bunch of adolescents who seem to be about his age. They were all holding little boxes in their hands that they spent a long time looking at. Then, Arthur realizes that he needs one of those boxes. But he didn’t have any money on him. He was just wearing what he wore under his armor and shoes. How long had he been knocked out? Had he died? Is he in hell? The adolescents let him “crash” on their couch because they found him attractive. Guess being hot had its perks, right? Still, he needed answers. He desperately needed Merlin. Maybe he was looking for him. Maybe he had died instead. Sacrificed himself for him. A life for a life. Arthur had cried at the thought that Merlin had been lost forever because he was too arrogant and stupid and impulsive to have not resisted fighting. And now the love of his life was gone. Because of him. One of the people who lived in the tiny castle they called a “condo” had stopped their smoking out of what he assumed was a glass sculpture to ask why he was so sad. The man looked dirty, but somehow like he fit in more than Arthur did. He had markings on his face. Maybe he was a cleric or a barbarian. When Arthur asked him about it earlier, he responded that he was a “baller” and a “savage” - whatever class that was, probably some new royal term he had slept through. “Hey, it’s okay. You can smoke some if you want,” the guy blows his smoke out away from him, making O’s and coughing a bit. He cried harder and then the man put his glass sculpture down to put a hand on his shoulder and sit next to him. “What’s wrong, man? You’re Arthur, right?” “Yes. King Arthur Pendragon.” “That’s a sick username. Is that your Twitter, Insta, TikTok, or all?” The man put a hand up, expecting Arthur to do something, and then put it down when he just cried some more. Arthur had no idea what any of that meant. “I lost everything. My best friend. He’s gone and I loved him. And my people are dead. And I’m lost. I have no money and I have no idea what’s happening. I just want Merlin back!” Arthur ranted angrily, feeling the fire in his chest as he wanted to kick something. He sagged onto the couch he was on and sighed. The man who went by the moniker of “DickWeed69” just sighed and took his box out. “Do you need to call this Merlin? That’s a unique name. Y’know he has the same name as this guy. Wait!” DickWeed69 starts poking his box furiously and pulls up a page. Arthur removes his hands from his eyes to look at the box. Lo and behold, it was Merlin! “How did you trap Merlin in this magic mirror? Are you a warlock?” “Dude, I’m a skateboarder and an influencer who runs Taco Bell’s Twitter. I’m not a D&amp;D player. I would be a bard, though. Definitely,” the man starts rubbing his chin in thought. Arthur looks at the box in disbelief. So he’s a scribe! A writer for Lord Taco Bell. “Sir DickWeed! Where can I find him?” Arthur sat up. “He lives in London. That’s like an hour away. Do you need an Uber?” “What the hell is an Uber?” - Arthur puts on the jacket that DickWeed69 gave him. It’s crimson, his favorite color. It also has a patch that says “Members Only” on it. Apparently, it was too large to fit anyone in the house and they had been planning to sell it at a “thrift shop” but then Arthur came along. The man also gives him a “burner phone” – which was supposed to be a smaller, less advanced version of the box that he had. When he arrives at the “Airbnb” that the man had gotten him, he immediately goes to sleep, his last thoughts being “I hope Merlin is out there.” Later that night, Arthur decides to explore the city of London. Apparently, it was a big deal so he wanted to see if it could top Camelot. After he arrives at some tavern-like place that had a bright light that resembled a rainbow, Arthur concludes that it did. There are a ton of men and women in there, all dancing to strange music and most of them were half-dressed. Arthur just assumed that it was someone’s birthday and this was the royal court’s performance. The jester appears and speaks so loud that it resounds throughout the banquet hall. It’s too dimly lit for Arthur’s liking, but he can navigate in the dark because of the flashing lights. Maybe they had special candles. So far, he had not seen any magic so he assumed that it was still outlawed. Then, the jester says that everyone should brace themselves because they were about to witness some magic. Arthur cringes and looks in shock as the men and women all cheer at that. Maybe it was not illegal anymore? Then, a very, very tall woman appears and starts dancing to a loud song, holding a fake sword and singing along to some hymn about some woman who wants to “cut to the feeling.” Arthur ponders about the concept of the people of London allowing women to be warriors. It wasn’t a horrible idea. Maybe that is why the place looked so nice. They must have conquered other countries. Likely pillaged people. When he had asked DickWeed69 about the place, he said that the country had been evil enough to colonize for hundreds of years. That was when he learned that he had been gone for over 2000 years. A few men are really friendly with him as he sits at the bar and broods. He would have enjoyed this festivity had Merlin been by his side, cracking jokes and looking cute. Arthur rejects all of the men and just drinks until he feels something again. Then, the head jester comes out and says, “Everyone! It’s time for some jokes! Our comedian tonight is internet famous for his web-series ‘Medieval Crimes’ where he investigates the mystery of the murders that happen at Medieval Times Show &amp; Dinner! He’s the Twink of Twitter, the Warlock of Gay Rights, and surprisingly a top, introducing our comic of the night: MERLINNNNNNN!” Arthur snaps his head up from his melancholy to look up. A small man in a familiar hunger-pang frame steps out in a very flashy jacket, underneath he has a floral shirt, incredibly tight pants, and strange shiny shoes with checks on them. He looks out into the crowd and smiles. It’s him. His dorky, small, lovely, awfully attractive Merlin. What the hell was he doing here? Merlin starts talking into the voice amplifier and he starts snarking about something he claims has happened to him. He makes jokes about being on TikTok and how hard it was to find good enough dates on Grindr. Then, he says that he misses his “ex that never was” – a hot blonde himbo who was a “prat” and lost in time and circumstance. Whoever that was, Arthur was already jealous of him. He made a note to find whoever this “himbo” guy was and give him a piece of his mind after breaking Merlin’s heart. But first, he had to get to Merlin. Merlin heads straight to the bar and takes his jacket off, tying it to his waist. It was huge on him, but it somehow suited him well. Arthur’s eyes follow him as fate has him sit right next to him. Oh, God. What would he say? He didn’t think that he could get this far! And by chance! He had spent most of his time awake from the dead - sleeping! What the fuck was he going to do? Then, Merlin takes a sip from his girly drink that seemed to glow in the dark. “You look like someone I used to know.” “So do you.” “I’m—” Arthur starts, but then Merlin is unbuttoning his shirt a few buttons down and leaning into his space. “Very attractive. And just my type.” This smartass. “I’m Merlin Emrys. The funniest man in London. And verified on Twitter.” “What’s Twitter?” Merlin chuckles and takes his phone out. He asks for his number and Arthur recites the digits that the man had told him to commit to memory. Then, Merlin asks to see his phone: “Androids are deal breakers.” “Holy fuck! Are you a drug dealer? Do you have some cocaine? Because I was not joking on stage when I said that I would definitely use some coke right now.” “They have coke in this bar. That caramel beverage…” Merlin giggles. Was he hitting on him? Soon enough, they head out of the tavern and Merlin takes him to his place. It’s much nicer than the Airbnb. And the castle in which DickWeed69 resides. Merlin tells him to sit down on the couch and watch some “Kardashians” - some short women all arguing with each other whilst smiling at their magic mirrors. Maybe they were royalty? When Merlin returns, he’s wearing sleeping attire, clothes with little lion prints. They looked like the Camelot emblem, but Arthur doesn’t say anything. In the middle of a riveting episode in which Princess Kim loses her diamond earrings in the water and she rages like a banshee, Merlin gasps as he puts his glasses on. Merlin always had shit eyesight. Guess the future had a solution for everything. “Okay, now that I have my eyes, you look EXACTLY like him. What was your name again?” He must have missed it because it was loud in the tavern. “King Arthur Pendragon.” “Holy. Fuck. Arthur! It’s you! You’re back!” “Duh.” - After they catch up, Arthur gives Merlin the biggest hug ever and he complains that he had woken up and was so lost without him. “Yeah, try waiting 2000 years, Arthur! It was so lonely! I never dated anyone and I had so many friends who died! And I never returned to Camelot. It hurt to be there without you.” Merlin was staring at him with watery eyes. He really waited that long. For him. Arthur recalled what he had said. “I do it. For you. Only for you.” Then, he pulls Merlin in for another hug. After Merlin explains what he’s been doing and how he ended up becoming a stand-up comedian (“You always seemed like a fool.”) and a social media influencer. “Oh, this would be such a good post, but then again, it would draw unnecessary attention. Better to include you later.” Arthur had no idea what that meant, but he yawned after he realized how tired he was. Merlin complimented his jacket, calling it “hipstery” and “totally a hunk look” - whatever that meant, then he gave him some clothes to wear to sleep. “Yeah, I don’t have a guest room so we have to share.” “Fine.” - When Merlin wakes up, Arthur’s arms are around him. He glances at the clock and closes his eyes. It’s early. Good thing he had a free day. A whole day dedicated to just relaxing. And now he had Arthur! What a bonus! They sleep until it’s noon. Merlin takes him out to a fancy restaurant. “How do you afford this as a bard?” “I’m an influencer. I get mad cash because I sell merch. Like the shirt you are wearing.” Arthur looked down at it. The nice button down shirt with a collar actually had stripes that said, “Merlin Emrys” all over. It was sleek and classy. Much unlike Merlin. But he justified the choice, saying he wanted to appeal to every crowd, “even normies like yourself” - whatever that was supposed to imply. Arthur would need a lesson on the new vernacular. Merlin talks animatedly throughout their “brunch” — some mealtime that was hailed as the best by women and men like Merlin who needed to gossip while drinking fruity beverages at overpriced cafés. He listens to him carefully and tries not to swoon at the sight of how good Merlin looked despite the years. Merlin had not aged a day and he looked hot in his glasses. “These are tortoise-shells. Not actual tortoise, just the pattern. Also, we definitely need to check your health in case you woke up with something. And you need to get your vaccinations because I heard there is a virus.” - After they get shots, Arthur receives a candy from the doctor because he freaked out when he saw the needle. Merlin gets an alert from his phone and he decides they go home. “You, of course, can live with me because I can’t have you getting lost in London.” “But—” “Come on, there’s a bloody virus!” Apparently, there is a “coronavirus” — so they have to stay inside until God knows when. Merlin had a ton of food. And more than enough supplies for two people. “This may be good, since no one else can see you. I get you all to myself,” Merlin says, smirking at Arthur’s blushing. “Lucky you. Now please explain to me this top and bottom thing. I am dying to understand.” Merlin cackled as he turned on the TV and got his phone out. He pulled Arthur by his hand to the couch and covered them with a blanket. “The modern world is truly a marvel.” “How did they not realize you have magic?” “Because they think the only magic comes from my mouth.” Arthur rolls his eyes and for the first time, he feels like he’s at ease in the new world. - “Why didn’t you date anyone? So many people for so long. Why not?” Merlin had stiffened and looked away. Serious for the first time. “Because I missed you so much. I couldn’t think of anyone else.” Arthur felt Merlin take his hand and rub circles into it. “You didn’t hav—” “No. I just couldn’t. I’d always wish it was you instead.” Then, Arthur doesn’t know what to say. Because he felt that way when he was with Gwen. And he couldn’t just cancel their union. Gwen was important to him. And the only way to help her was to marry her. She couldn’t be a servant forever. Now she’s gone and he could really use her counsel. Instead, he does the stupid thing because he doesn’t have anyone to tell him otherwise and he had been relying on his first thought, best thought for the past few days. He kisses Merlin. And Merlins kisses him right back. They spend like a good hour doing that until Arthur pulls away and says, “Wait, have you not fucked since I died?” “Since long before that because you are oblivious as hell.” “Not anymore.” He grins as he and Arthur run to his bedroom. They had finally found each other because Arthur had risen again. Merlin thought that it was definitely worth the wait. - New Tweet from Merlin Emrys ✔ Merlin Emrys ✔ @EmrysedItAll dsfjlskdjfkhd my boyfriend EMERGED from a lake??? now we are in quarantine??? what the fuck is 2020!! kim petras and charli better release new music!!!

Lucky for him, Morgana is a wealth of advice and knows exactly what Arthur should do. Notes The title is a quote from author Marianne Moore. Written for Merlin Canon Fest: Episode 1X10-The Moment of Truth Thank you to my amazing beta, Peledryn. You, my dear, rock my socks off!

No profit is being made, and no copyright infringement is intended. Arthur stared at the empty space that had only seconds before been filled with Merlin and wondered how it had come to pass that a cheeky, clumsy, gangly boy from Ealdor had come to take up such a large part of his life in such a relatively short period of time. He also pondered what life would be like after Merlin left and returned to Ealdor, but he didn’t have to think on that one long before deducing that life without Merlin would be boring and sad. The thought sent a wave of what he would deny to others but admit to himself as near panic through Arthur as he turned away from the entrance into the castle and looked out over the bustling courtyard below. How many of those people had been helped by Merlin? Camelot had benefitted in many ways from Arthur’s manservant’s presence; his departure would leave a huge empty hole. Yes, Merlin had been a constant thorn in Arthur’s side from day one, but that irritating pain that had refused to go away when he’d wanted it to had changed Arthur in many ways. He wasn’t ready to say goodbye. Arthur did understand, though, that Merlin had no choice but to go. His village was threatened and his mother had been assaulted. The truth of it was that Merlin had an obligation to his mother that trumped any standing agreement to a future king. “He’s leaving?” Arthur sighed as he watched Morgana saunter out onto the roof and stand beside him, looking properly sympathetic as she focused her bright green eyes on him. Oddly, this upset him. In almost any situation, Morgana could be counted on to be the voice of reason; she knew how to set the King’s son to rights when he needed it, most especially when he thought he didn’t. Arthur yearned for those helpful, direct words this day, not commiserating platitudes. A “yes” was all he could manage, and he hoped it hadn’t sounded as petulant as he thought it might have. “Hmm...” Morgana looked out over the courtyard, seemingly deep in thought. “Is there no hope of him returning?” she finally asked when she turned to face Arthur and leant against the battlements. “Surely there is nothing in Ealdor that would keep him there permanently,” she added with a hint of pompousness that Morgana was so very good at. She could be as sweet and caring as a first-time mother watching over her recently born pups or as brash as an angry, charging boar after being pierced with an arrow. Arthur was forever grateful that he was one of those people his father’s ward liked; he didn’t fancy ever being on the receiving end of an uncharitable Morgana. “His mother lives there, Morgana.” Arthur’s grip on one of the crenels tightened as he looked away. Encouraging his unwarranted growing dependence on Merlin was the last thing he needed Morgana to do. There was a time Arthur had wondered if Morgana were jealous of Merlin because he now spent more time with Arthur than Morgana did. Why couldn’t she take that angle now and be pleased that the strange boy from the land beyond Escetir (check spelling) was leaving? “If you knew your mother was in trouble, would you not move heaven and earth to get to her?” he asked, but even as the words came out of his mouth he regretted them—no one, not even his father, knew where Morgana’s mother was—but Morgana was sometimes so very selfish and needed to be reminded that the world did not revolve around her. His father had once told Arthur that it was he, not Morgana, who was the selfish one. Arthur hadn’t believed a word of that, but now he wasn’t so sure. Everyone seemed to flock towards his father’s ward, yet those same people tended to keep their distance from the future king. Just maybe his father had been right. “For what it’s worth, I’m sorry, Arthur,” was Morgana’s sulky reply, seemingly ignoring the previous statement altogether. “The boy is sweet and did wonders for your disposition. I will be sorry to see him go.” Arthur nodded but couldn’t say anything. Not so many hours before, Gaius had made a similar remark when Arthur had asked the physician if Merlin would be going back to Ealdor. “ I think you know the answer to that question, sire, but I do think he will return; he travelled many hours by foot to arrive in Camelot and is here for a reason. I cannot see him staying away. And, if I might for a moment use my advanced age to make a bold statement, the two of you are good for one another; it would be a shame if you were forever parted. ” Arthur had begun to ask what Gaius meant, but an appearance by the King had put an end to that and there hadn’t been another opportunity. Arthur wasn’t completely clueless, however. And now it seemed that the court physician wasn’t the only one with similar thoughts. Maybe Arthur’s fanciful ideas weren’t altogether without merit. He questioned his sanity all the same. When he realised there wasn’t a proper response within him to give Morgana’s not-quite-but- verging-on cloying statement, Arthur let out a mirthless laugh and shook his head as if ridding himself of unwanted thoughts. Why did he even care about any of this? Merlin was hopeless. Truly hopeless. He was a passable servant and a help to Gaius, but the absence of his irritating presence wouldn’t be felt for long—someone else would fill his spot and life would carry on as it always had. The citadel wouldn’t stop because Merlin left. But if that was the way of it, then why did the prospect of Merlin departing leave such an empty space within Arthur? “He hasn’t left yet, Arthur. You should go to him,” Morgana added as she frowned. “And do what, Morgana?” asked Arthur as he leant against the battlement and crossed his arms. “Tell him he’s the best friend I’ve ever had? The only friend? Admit that until he came along no one other than my father, you, and Gaius cared about my wellbeing? Profess my undying love for him? Ask him to stay with me and warm my bed? Ask him to love me? I hardly think Merlin would take kindly to either of those. And why would he? I never let an opportunity to berate him pass me by.” Morgana cleared her throat and let out a chuckle. “Arthur, dear, every rose has a thorn.” Arthur felt somewhat lightheaded at his overwrought admissions and Morgana’s less than pleasing response; he closed his eyes momentarily to gather his bearings. Morgana looked at him with all the sadness that Arthur himself felt. Why did it have to be Merlin that Arthur wanted? Why couldn’t it have been Morgana? She was pretty, smart, learned in the ways of being a royal, and was here, not going anywhere. But she was Morgana. They would clash at every turn. Still, she would be easy to be with and would fit in seamlessly. Merlin never would. Was that the life Arthur wanted? To be with someone his father would never approve of? Did he wish to alienate his future subjects? They no doubt expected him to one day marry a beautiful princess and sire a future king and perhaps an adorable princess. Until a few months ago, those had been Arthur’s expectations for himself as well. But then Merlin had come into his life and everything had changed. What should he do? Arthur had no answers, but what he did have was a growing hole where Merlin had been… and Merlin wasn’t even gone yet. “What you say or do is up to you, Arthur dear, but it is patently clear that you have unresolved business with Merlin and need to see him again before he leaves. If you don’t, I fear you will be unbearable to live with. And perhaps, if you can wade through all the clouded emotions in that head and heart of yours, you will see that there is a solution to this staring at you. If you want Merlin to return to you, do something about it.” She then placed a kiss on his cheek before leaving him to his thoughts. Arthur watched her leave and attempted to reason with himself that with her by his side, Camelot would thrive. Arthur adored her as did the people who resided within and around the realm. But Arthur didn’t love her, and that was what it all came down to. No, love didn’t have to come into the equation—most marriages were arranged in families such as his—but he had never felt right about a loveless union. Perhaps that was because his father had loved his mother. Arthur hadn’t seen that love firsthand, but he had heard about it and knew it was that which now made it impossible for him to enter a relationship for anything other than love. Oh well, perhaps another royal envoy would make its way to Camelot soon and one of the visiting kings’ daughters would catch Arthur’s interest. It had happened before, and there was no reason to believe it wouldn’t happen again. Why he had found himself enamoured with Merlin in the first place baffled him. He had never fancied men. One of his father’s knights was secretly involved with one of the younger trainees, and Arthur often saw them sneak a kiss or a caress before or after training, or whilst on a hunt, but Arthur had never looked at another male with anything akin to attraction. It would have to be Merlin that changed all of that. But since his initial encounter with Merlin, Arthur hadn’t found any other male to his liking, so it wasn’t as if Merlin were merely a catalyst to open Arthur’s eyes. It just didn’t make sense. Or perhaps it did. Arthur scrubbed his face with his hands and began walking towards the door. What madness had Morgana been referring to when she said there was an answer to this? He found out when he entered his chambers later that afternoon after meeting with his father. There was a parchment on his desk that simply read, “Go help him, Arthur, then bring him back.” It was in Morgana’s beautiful flowy writing. He only had to ponder Morgana&#x27;s suggestion for a brief moment before he decided that this was exactly what he would do. As he prepared to leave he was heartened to find out that Morgana and Guinevere had gone with Merlin to help. He gave his horse a workout it would never forget in his pursuit of Merlin, and he spent the next several days making sure that Kanen would never again hurt Merlin’s mother or village. By the time Kanen and his thugs were either killed or run off, Arthur’s emotions had run the gamut. He had rallied the inhabitants of Merlin’s tiny village, something he had been trained from birth to do, and he had faced truths from Guinevere that he’d hoped not to, something he had not at all been prepared for. Was he truly out of touch with his people? That’s what Guinevere had implied. Of course she had apologised and tried to take back her words, but she had said them. Perhaps he needed to be a little less critical and much more accepting. It wasn’t a realisation Arthur was happy about, but it was worth looking into. But the most important realisation for Arthur over the past few days had resulted from Arthur’s talks with Merlin. His confused and muddled feelings of a few days earlier that had him thinking he was somehow in love with Merlin had ever so slowly morphed into him knowing with all his heart that there would never be another for him. It had been a heady realisation and for several hours the day before, Arthur had wandered the wood alone, trying to come to terms with his feelings. A day onward hadn’t done much to help Arthur accept what his heart had known for months, but the cool breeze wafting through his hair as he made his way back home did wonders for him. “We haven’t had a chance to talk much,” said Morgana as her horse cantered up to his. “Have you spoken to Merlin?” “Yes, as Will was taking an arrow for me I professed my undying love for his best friend,” said a sarcastic Arthur. but then he shook his head in that self-deprecating way of his. “Erm, sorry, that was uncalled for, but no, it was hardly the time or the place. We were busy trying to save his village if you remember, Morgana.” Morgana’s sigh and look said that she thought Arthur was making excuses. Maybe he was. Truth was that he had very nearly told Merlin how he felt on a couple of occasions, but for one reason or another he hadn’t. One of those times he had even thought that maybe Merlin had something to tell him as well. “Don’t you think it’s about time you faced this, Arthur? I can see that it’s wreaking havoc on you.” Morgana turned and looked behind her to where Guinevere was bringing up the rear. “When we make camp, Gwen and I will go search for wood to keep the fire going. I suggest you take that time to talk to Merlin.” Without a reply Arthur took off at a gallop to catch up with Merlin. Sometime later, as Merlin was setting up camp and preparing supper, Morgana and Gwen went running off, giggling like young maidens who had spotted a potential suitor. Arthur sat by the small stream and watched Merlin. To this day Arthur couldn’t wrap his mind around the fact that Merlin had almost died for him. Yes, Arthur had nearly done the same for Merlin, but it was a response to what Merlin had done for him. When Merlin drank the poison, he’d done so knowing the likelihood that he would die. Merlin stood and walked towards his horse. He really was too beautiful for words, and when he turned and smiled at Arthur, it took every ounce of restraint for Arthur not to blurt out that he loved Merlin. Arthur grabbed a small piece of bark, retrieved his knife, and began whittling, but he never took his eyes off of Merlin for long. “Supper is almost ready, sire. I hope the girls will be back soon.” Merlin took a bite of whatever it was that he’d decided to cook, then walked over to where Arthur was and sat beside him. “I didn’t know you whittled.” Arthur grinned as he continued stripping the piece of its bark. “There are many things you don’t know about me, Merlin.” He expected this would have elicited a cheeky response, but it didn’t. Instead, Merlin’s previous- almost-carefree demeanour was replaced with a solemnity that Arthur knew all too well. It was never easy losing someone close to you. “I’m sorry you had to lose Will, Merlin.” Arthur knew it was an empty comment—he’d already said this very thing on numerous occasions—but if he said it every day for the remainder of his life it wouldn’t be enough. It was down to him that Merlin’s best friend was now little more than ashes and fertilizer. Merlin took a deep breath then stood and walked back to his horse. When he returned he handed Arthur a package. Arthur studied it for several seconds. “Open it,” was Merlin’s soft command. Nothing else for it, Arthur did as asked, his curiosity piqued. It was wrapped quite nicely. No doubt someone other than Merlin had done it—he’d seen how Merlin wrapped gifts, and it wasn’t a pretty sight. Finally he came to a box. He carefully opened it, and his breath caught in his throat. Inside, lying upon a cushion of what looked like silk, were three red roses. Two were dried and old from the look of them, and one was fresh. Arthur was confused. Why had Merlin given him three red roses, two of them long ago dried up? He looked up but had no idea what to say. Merlin let out a chuckle. “When I was little, Will and me did everything together. We were the best of friends, and I thought nothing would ever separate us.” Merlin then carefully retrieved one of the dried roses. “This was Will’s. I gave it to him the day I left Ealdor to come to Camelot. I don’t even know why I did it.” Arthur let out a brief laugh and rolled his eyes as he shook his head, something Merlin was by now well accustomed to. “Okay, yeah, erm, I might have wanted him to have something to remember me by,” Merlin added as if it were the most difficult confession he’d ever made. “Mum and me don’t have much so I knew whatever I gave him wouldn’t be much, but I had to give him something. I picked this from my mum’s garden.” Merlin turned the stem and watched the rose intently, as if it would bloom and fly away. “It was all I could do, Arthur.” He then turned to look at Arthur. “It is all we can do.” There was no mistaking the emphasis on the ‘we.’ And there was no mistaking the meaning. Arthur briefly closed his eyes and took a deep breath before he reached over and retrieved the other dried rose, deciding, at least for the moment, to delay the inevitable. “And this one?” he asked just as his thumb made contact with a thorn. He made a face but said nothing. Leave it to Merlin to leave thorns on dried roses. “I made it all the way to the wood by the time Will caught up to me. He was out of breath when he handed it to me. He didn’t say anything, but I watched as a tear rolled down his face.” Arthur swallowed. “You let him go?” he asked incredulously. When Merlin’s face crumpled, Arthur felt bad for his tone, but how could Merlin have left? How could he have done that? “I had to, Arthur.” Arthur heard the sadness in Merlin’s voice. He set down Merlin’s rose and picked up the beautiful and very much alive red rose. “And this?” he asked, his heart beating much faster now as he looked into Merlin’s shining blue eyes. Merlin took the rose from Arthur and, along with the other, watched them as they turned in his fingers. “It is all I can give you, Arthur. Nothing more. Maybe later, when things are made clearer, but not now. All I can give you for now is a single red rose that will one day soon look like this one,” he said as he gently settled the dead rose back on its cushion of silk. “There are things I can’t tell you, Arthur. Perhaps one day, but not today. Please don’t ask. Please let today be enough.” Arthur attempted a nod but wasn’t sure it materialised. “You don’t need to give me anything, Merlin.” Arthur felt his heart shattering into a million pieces. Merlin was turning him down before he had even told him how he felt. “You must know that I carry you with me everywhere I go. You must know that, yes?” he repeated, as if he needed to know that Merlin understood. “Yeah, I do,” was the whispered reply from Merlin, now placing the red rose in Arthur’s hand before leaning in and kissing him gently. It lasted but a second, and then Merlin was again sitting beside him and looking at the rose Arthur held to his heart. Arthur studied the rose and marvelled at its beauty, with its petals perfectly placed. He handed it to Merlin. “Please keep it for me?” Merlin took the rose in hand and gently set it beside Will’s and his. He then looked at Arthur, tears welling in his eyes. Arthur thought he should probably stand up and walk away lest he lose his composure as well, but he remembered Morgana’s words from earlier. She and Gwen were staying away on purpose so Arthur could talk to Merlin. Thus far it had been Merlin who had done most of the talking, but now it was time for Arthur to be brave and do his own. “When you nearly died after drinking that poison, Merlin, I despaired of losing you,” he said as he took the box from Merlin and set it on the ground before taking both of Merlin’s hands in his. “And then when you told me the other day that you were leaving I again felt despondent. I couldn’t imagine a life without you in Camelot.” Merlin chuckled as he picked up the partially whittled wood that Arthur had been working on. He took the offered knife and went to work. “Your father would skin me alive if he knew his son fancied me.” Arthur’s own laugh, mirthless though it was, followed. “Leave it to you to take a serious moment where I am trying to confess my feelings for you and ruin it by bringing up my father.” But Arthur really couldn’t be bothered that his unplanned speech had been thwarted. He wouldn’t be at all upset if all his future plans were thwarted by Merlin. “Erm, Sorry?” was Merlin’s not at all genuine response before he cleared his throat and adopted a serious look. “I promise to never bring up your father again when talking about you and me.” But the small chuckle rather ruined the image he had no doubt been trying to put forth. Arthur rolled his eyes. He would have to fall for a bumbling idiot, wouldn’t he? Oh well, perhaps that was how it was meant to be. There were worse fates, he was sure. “If what you say about my father is true, Merlin, which, I have to admit it probably is, then it is up to me to make sure he never finds out about us. I have nearly lost you twice. I refuse to go through that again.” And with that said, Arthur made a split-second decision. Perhaps the rose was all they could ever be after today, but today wasn’t over yet, was it? “When Morgana and Guinevere get back do you want to go for a walk?” he asked as nonchalantly as possible, but his insides were anything but calm. He willed Merlin to say yes, but what if he didn’t? Arthur wasn’t at all ready to let today go. Not yet. If Merlin said no... “Yeah, we could do that,” Merlin responded, a huge grin on his face. “When I was younger, Will and I often came here and camped out. Maybe I can show you some of my favourite places,” he added with a cheeky grin and a wink. Arthur looked around and fervently hoped that the girls would hurry up and return. They had had plenty of time to do whatever it was that King’s wards and their Ladies Maids did in the cover of wood. It was now his and Merlin’s turn. Right on cue, two figures made their way out of the wood, looking quite happy and content. With any luck, in about an hour Arthur and Merlin would emerge looking the same. Not caring that Morgana and Guinevere could see them, Arthur stood, pulled Merlin up, and the two ran in the opposite direction. He yelled to Morgana that they would be back before dark. All he heard was a laugh as he took Merlin’s hand in his and they entered the wood. Seconds later Arthur pushed Merlin up against a tree, not quite believing that he was here with the man he loved. “Are you going to stare at me, or are you going to kiss me?” Merlin asked, looking all coy and innocent. Arthur smirked. For someone who had minutes earlier informed Arthur that a rose was all he could ever give him, Merlin certainly was being demanding. Such impudence almost necessitated a sly response, but Arthur had other plans…. Plans that included not allowing Merlin’s innocence to last another second. Arthur leant in and covered Merlin with his body before kissing those beautiful lips. He wasn’t sure, but Arthur thought that perhaps he wouldn’t have to worry any longer about empty spaces where Merlin had been.</span> <a href="#" class="summary-toggle">[ + ]</a></div><div class="stats"><div class="stat-item"><strong>Rating:</strong> Teen And Up Audiences</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Archive Warning:</strong> No Archive Warnings Apply</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Category:</strong> M/M</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Fandom:</strong> Merlin (TV)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Relationship:</strong> Merlin/Arthur Pendragon (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Character:</strong> Arthur Pendragon (Merlin), Merlin (Merlin), Morgana (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Additional Tags:</strong> Canon Era, Alternate Universe - Canon Divergence, Missing Scene, Episode: s01e10 The Moment of Truth, Pining, Boys In Love, Merlin Canon Fest, Angst</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Series:</strong> Part 14 of Merlin Episodes: AUs, Missing Scenes, and Inspired By</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Collections:</strong> Merlin Canon 2018</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Published:</strong> 2018-09-30</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Words:</strong> 4096</div></div></div><div class="work-entry"><h2 class="title"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://download.archiveofourown.org/downloads/23317564/aithusa.pdf?updated_at=1585171265" target="_blank">aithusa</a></h2><div class="summary"><span class="summary-short">When Merlin takes the dragon egg to Kilgharrah, he takes Arthur along for the experience. &quot;Arthur.&quot; Merlin hissed, shaking the sleeping king&#x27;s arm. &quot; Arthur .

Wake up.&quot; Arthur groaned, annoyed, and opened his eyes. &quot;Merlin,&quot; He said. &quot;Why on earth are you waking me up in the middle of the night? And why didn&#x27;t you come back here after you went to see Gaius?&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m sorry,&quot; Merlin said then kissed his lover&#x27;s lips gently. &quot;I had supper with him and then, well, I had to prepare for something. Come on. We have to go now.&quot; Merlin said then leaped off the bed and began pulling clothes out of Arthur&#x27;s wardrobe. &quot;Merlin?&quot; Arthur questioned him. &quot;Prepare for what? What do you think you&#x27;re doing?&quot; &quot;You&#x27;ve got to get dressed,&quot; Merlin said. &quot;You and I have a meeting to get to.&quot; &quot;Uh,&quot; Arthur furrowed his brows. &quot;No, we don&#x27;t.&quot; &quot;Yeah, we do.&quot; Merlin said. &quot;It&#x27;s just that you&#x27;re only now finding out about it. Do you remember what I told you about the Last Dragon the day that you found out about my powers?&quot; &quot;Ah, yes,&quot; Arthur sighed as he threw the covers back and swung his legs over the edge of the bed. He got to his feet and, despite himself, did as Merlin said and began dressing. &quot;Kilgharrah. The Last and Great Dragon. The one you told me I had slain, but it turns out he&#x27;s alive! Thanks again for that, Merlin. Anyway, what about him?&quot; &quot;We&#x27;re meeting with him,&quot; Merlin said. &quot;Wait, what?&quot; Arthur said. &quot;No. I am not meeting with a — Merlin, you didn&#x27;t.&quot; &quot;Didn&#x27;t what?&quot; Merlin said, playing dumb with a huge grin on his face. &quot;Oh, dear gods,&quot; Arthur sighed heavily, exasperated. &quot;Merlin, please tell me that you didn&#x27;t save that dragon egg!&quot; &quot;I had to!&quot; Merlin exclaimed. &quot;Kilgharrah will be the last of his kind forever if this egg never hatches and as the last Dragonlord, it is my duty to protect the dragons. Now, come on. I&#x27;m going to show you something and I&#x27;m reasonably certain that we&#x27;re the only two people alive who will be able to say we&#x27;ve seen such a thing.&quot; Arthur looked unsure. &quot;It will be amazing,&quot; Merlin said. He grasped Arthur&#x27;s hand and squeezed. &quot;I promise.&quot; With another sigh, Arthur nodded. &quot;Okay, fine. I&#x27;ll just get dressed and then we can leave.&quot; So he pulled on a shirt and threw one of his leather jackets on over, then yanked a pair of boots onto his feet. He put on a belt with his sword&#x27;s sheath attached and slipped the weapon in. &quot;Alright, let&#x27;s go.&quot; &quot;Is the sword really necessary?&quot; Merlin sighed. &quot;We&#x27;re going to meet a dragon and we&#x27;re bringing a dragon egg,&quot; Arthur huffed, and he rolled his eyes. &quot;Yes, the sword is absolutely necessary.&quot; &quot;We&#x27;re going to meet a dragon that can&#x27;t be killed by an ordinary sword with a dragon egg that cannot be destroyed by an ordinary sword,&quot; Merlin said, pulling his satchel over his head and letting it hang across his body. &quot;Besides, I&#x27;ve spoken to Kilgharrah many times since his supposed death. He&#x27;s my friend, and I his. He will not harm us. And even if he were to make an attempt to harm either of us, I could stop him simply by commanding him. A dragon can not resist a Dragonlord, even if they want to.&quot; &quot;Very well,&quot; Arthur said, setting the sword aside. &quot;Let&#x27;s get on with it, then.&quot; And so they set off, through the castle and out into the night. Through the woods they went, until they came to a very large clearing. &quot;What now?&quot; Arthur asked. Merlin smirked at the king before turning his gaze skyward. When he spoke, Arthur was taken aback by how deep and powerful his voice was. &quot; Draca, eom, ala, sece findan metan, teosu hus anbid! Ærne! &quot; Arthur gaped at him for a few moments before he turned his gaze skyward as well. The sound of incredibly large wings flapping in flight rented the air until the dragon that had just appeared landed in front of Merlin and Arthur. The king&#x27;s mouth was hanging open and he sputtered unintelligibly, trying to say something , but he was at a loss for words. &quot;Merlin,&quot; Kilgharrah said, eyeing Arthur suspiciously. &quot;Would you care to explain to me why you have brought along the King of Camelot?&quot; &quot;He talks,&quot; Arthur said dumbly. &quot;What have you done, young warlock?&quot; the dragon sighed. &quot;Oh, erm, about that,&quot; Merlin began, rubbed the back of his neck in an awkward manner. &quot;I may have failed to mention that Arthur here sort of...found out about my powers. Several months ago.&quot; He laughed nervously. Arthur wasn&#x27;t listening to a word either of them were saying. He was too busy staring at Kilgharrah with a mixed expression of horror and wonder. A dragon, he kept thinking to himself. A dragon! He wasn&#x27;t at all sure how to feel about any of it, but he knew for one thing that the dragon wasn&#x27;t — at the moment — trying to hurt or kill him and that was a plus. On the other hand, it was causing quite the internal conflict within Arthur as he had been taught all of his life to resent all things magic... Now look at me , he thought. I share a bed with a creature of magic every night. If only my father could see me now! &quot; Merlin ,&quot; Kilgharrah hissed. &quot;It&#x27;s fine,&quot; Merlin reassured the mighty dragon. &quot;He knows everything and he&#x27;s accepted it. All of it. Haven&#x27;t you, Arthur?&quot; &quot;I — uhm — what was the question again?&quot; Arthur asked. Merlin and Kilgharrah both sighed. &quot;Besides the point,&quot; Merlin said to the dragon. &quot;He&#x27;s completely accepting, he&#x27;s just in a bit of shock at the moment, I think. And, anyway, I&#x27;ve brought you something.&quot; Merlin took his bag off of his shoulders and laid it down on the grass. From it he pulled an egg that he placed on a wooden post. An egg that was a brilliant royal purple, which faded into white, and that white faded back into purple. &quot;So,&quot; Merlin smiled up at Kilgharrah. &quot;You&#x27;re no longer the last of your kind.&quot; All of the anger in Kilgharrah&#x27;s eyes drained away when he saw the egg, and he smiled. &quot;It would appear so,&quot; Arthur was staring at the egg, now, and he still didn&#x27;t know how to feel about any of this and he was really wishing now that Merlin had left him in bed and had just done this on his own. But he looked back up at Kilgharrah and, now that the dragon was no longer angry with Merlin, no longer glaring at Arthur, he looked... peaceful. &quot;When will it hatch?&quot; Merlin asked. &quot;A dragon egg can only be hatched by a Dragonlord,&quot; said Kilgharrah and Arthur&#x27;s gaze turned to Merlin, acknowledging his presence for the first time since they arrived. &quot;As the last Dragonlord, that responsibility now falls to you, Merlin.&quot; Merlin considered this. &quot;How do I hatch the egg?&quot; &quot;You must give the dragon a name,&quot; Kilgharrah said. &quot;A name?&quot; Arthur said. &quot;That&#x27;s it?&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; Kilgharrah nodded slowly, obviously irritated by Arthur once more. &quot;Okay, I&#x27;ll do it,&quot; Merlin said. He closed his eyes and scrunched his face up in intense concentration. He stood there in thought for a solid minute before he spoke in that low tone that seemed to emit raw power. &quot; Aithusa. &quot; The moment the name left his lips, a long crack appeared in the egg&#x27;s shell. There was a small tapping nose came from within and then a white snout broke through the eggshell. It was followed by a head, a body, and beautiful little wings until the eggshell fell to the ground in pieces and the small dragon stood on the post, sucking in its first breath of fresh air with obvious content and an adorable smile on its face. In that moment, Arthur forgot all about his inner conflicts with magic and dragons and he began to wonder how anyone could ever hate something so precious and beautiful. He thought that magic, if used for good, could be a very wonderful thing. As he watched a baby dragon come into the world, Arthur began to question everything that his father had ever taught him. &quot;A white dragon,&quot; Kilgharrah mused. &quot;How very rare. And how very fitting, indeed. For the name you have bestowed upon her, Aithusa, means light. This is no coincidence, Merlin. This is a sign. Albion will be united. She represents the light that will show you the way, I&#x27;m sure of it.&quot; Arthur and Merlin both smiled. Arthur looked up at Kilgharrah and spoke to him. &quot;Where will she go?&quot; &quot;Dragons have a way of finding their own way in the world,&quot; Kilgharrah said. &quot;She will go off on her own very soon, but fear not. She will be fine.&quot; The Great Dragon nodded his head toward the newborn, and the king and the sorcerer turned to look at her. Aithusa was flapping her tiny wings, making an attempt to fly. &quot;Until she leaves, I will look over her.&quot; Kilgharrah promised. &quot;You two should get back to the castle now.&quot; &quot;Thank you,&quot; Merlin said. &quot;No, Merlin,&quot; Kilgharrah shook his head. &quot;Thank you . You have restored my kind. And thank you, as well, Arthur.&quot; &quot;For what?&quot; Arthur asked, puzzled. &quot;For striving to see beauty in the things your father could only ever hate,&quot; Kilgharrah said. &quot;For being open to unlearning that hate that Uther instilled in you from the time of your birth.&quot; Arthur smiled, nodded, and then he and Merlin bid the dragon goodbye, and set off, back through the woods and towards the castle. &quot;So,&quot; said Merlin. &quot;Is your view on dragons and magic and all things of the sort changed forever or what?&quot; And Arthur couldn&#x27;t help the smile that spread across his face. &quot;Yes, I think it is. I&#x27;m going to work to legalize magic in Camelot. It will take time, of course. If I was to do it all at once then every evil sorcerer would begin working feverishly at once, and every person who uses magic for good would work in the open and would likely be killed by their neighbors. But I promise you, Merlin, that one day you will see your people walk free without having to hide who they truly are.&quot; &quot;I understand why you have to wait, of course,&quot; Merlin said and smiled once more. &quot;Thank you.&quot; &quot;Of course,&quot; Arthur nodded. &quot;Magic, it seems, can be very beautiful...as I&#x27;ve now seen with my own eyes.&quot; &quot;Aithusa was very beautiful, wasn&#x27;t she.&quot; Merlin nodded. Arthur wrapped an arm around the young warlock and beamed. &quot;I was talking about you , Merlin.&quot; And he stopped walking to kiss his lover sweetly. Merlin blushed and Arthur laughed before he laced his fingers through Merlin&#x27;s and they continued on their way back to the castle.</span> <a href="#" class="summary-toggle">[ + ]</a></div><div class="stats"><div class="stat-item"><strong>Rating:</strong> General Audiences</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Archive Warning:</strong> No Archive Warnings Apply</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Category:</strong> M/M</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Fandom:</strong> Merlin (TV)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Relationship:</strong> Merlin/Arthur Pendragon (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Character:</strong> Merlin (Merlin), Arthur Pendragon (Merlin), Kilgharrah (Merlin), Aithusa (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Additional Tags:</strong> Established Relationship, Arthur Knows About Merlin&#x27;s Magic (Merlin), Cute, Episode: s04e04 Aithusa</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Published:</strong> 2020-03-25</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Words:</strong> 1806</div></div></div><div class="work-entry"><h2 class="title"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://download.archiveofourown.org/downloads/25469029/i%20knew%20i%20was%20saved%20and.pdf?updated_at=1595526362" target="_blank">i knew i was saved and could bear him</a></h2><div class="summary"><span class="summary-short">Uther crashes Arthur and Merlin&#x27;s engagement party.

Hunith has a few things to say about that. Notes This one is a bit of a rollercoaster lol. I&#x27;ve been wanting to write both Merlin and Morgana as best friends and a confrontation between Hunith and Uther for a while, and this combines those two ideas. Please let me know what you think in the comments! warnings: short homophobic rant by (you&#x27;ll never guess!) Uther disclaimer: i do not own any of these characters title from Mary Oliver&#x27;s &#x27;A Visitor&#x27; “Merlin!” Morgana trots across the room, graceful as always in her far too tall heels, and envelops Merlin in a crushing hug. “Hello, light of my life,” Merlin replies, adopting the tone Arthur knows he gets from imitating period drama characters, “How is the most beautiful lady in the realm doing today?” “Quite poorly, actually.” Morgana deposits her purse on a barstool. “I’ve just learned that my brother has stolen the man I’m in love with from me.” Arthur rolls his eyes and grumps fondly, “I should’ve known dating my sister’s best friend would never lead to anything good.” Merlin and Morgana cackle, like the evil little fiends they are. Morgana takes Arthur’s hand, her eyes going soft. “Ignoring the fact that Merlin and I are in love—” “A fact which, as I’ve stated many times, is categorically false, seeing as he’s gay and you’re a lesbian—” “Slander. But seriously, Arthur, congratulations. I was absolutely over the moon when I heard.” She hugs him and plants a kiss on his cheek. Arthur reminds himself to go wash off the lipstick mark as soon as possible. “I’m so proud of you, little bro.” “No one, in the history of human relationships, has ever called their sibling ‘little bro’, and you will retract that statement immediately or I’ll have Hunith walk me down the aisle instead of you.” Morgana slaps Arthur’s arm, but she’s smiling, that wide, crinkle-eyed grin she gets when she can’t contain her happiness, and Arthur feels an insurmountable rush of affection for his sister. Then Gwen and Lance are arriving with their own hugs and congratulations, and Morgana waltzes off towards the buffet. Arthur leans against the bar after everyone has arrived, feeling quietly content. Merlin had called him a sap and a posh prat for wanting to have an engagement party (“we already see everyone on a regular basis and they’re all coming to the wedding anyway. It’s just like having two wedding receptions. Which is exactly the sort of thing ridiculous rich people like you partake in”), but Arthur is glad to see all their friends together and enjoying themselves. By the buffet, Mithian, Percy, and Freya are hooting with laughter at something Elena said. Leon and Elyan are engrossed in conversation with Merlin’s great-uncle Gaius. At one of the tables, Will and Gwaine are loudly recounting a story to a concerned-looking Hunith. Arthur considers rescuing her, but decides Hunith is more than capable of handling the situation. “Enjoying yourself?” Merlin asks, sidling up to Arthur. “Very much so.” Arthur pecks Merlin on the lips. “You’re lucky to have such a wonderful fiancé who lets you indulge in your over-the-top aristocratic tendencies.” “I really am.” “Sop.” Merlin kisses Arthur, long and sweet this time. Morgana joins them once more at the bar, now carrying a plate heaped with food. Merlin slides an arm around her waist and helps himself to an olive from her plate. With Morgana comes the rest of the crowd, everyone forming a loose circle alive with chatter. Somehow the conversation flows from reminiscing about Arthur and Merlin getting together to telling embarrassing stories about them. “Arthur likes to pretend he’s Mr. Serious,” Morgana is saying, “but I can testify that he had Pokémon bedsheets until he was at least seventeen.” “They’re still in the linen closet in our flat,” Merlin adds. Laughter ripples around the room. “Merlin and Morgana have been taking salsa classes together for four years,” Arthur deadpans. “If you’re trying to embarrass us, it’s not going to work,” Merlin retorts. “I’ll have you know that Morgana and I are salsa prodigies.” “Prove it,” Gwaine goads. “Fine,” Morgana says, lifting her chin. After some tinkering, they get an appropriate song playing on the venue’s sound system, and Merlin bows to Morgana, offering his hand. They really are excellent salsa dancers, Arthur thinks as he watches them twirl. Morgana’s wearing a dark green dress with a pleated skirt that swirls around her legs, and Merlin, normally so clumsy, is perfectly coordinated. Once again it hits Arthur how lucky he is to have them both in his life, to have everyone in this room. Morgana may be the only person here he’s related to by blood, but she is by no means his only family. The song ends with Merlin dipping Morgana, and applause rings out. The door to the venue creaks open, and Morgana scrambles back to her feet, her face falling. Arthur frowns in confusion; he can’t think of anyone he invited who isn’t already here. He looks up. It’s his father. The room is silent as Uther strides in. Arthur had given his email to the event planning agency months ago, when he’d first bought the ring and reserved the venue, and had forgotten Uther was on the guestlist. Not that Arthur would have necessarily removed him if he’d remembered; though he knows he’s almost certainly better off without his father in his life, he’s self-aware enough to acknowledge that he still wants the man’s approval. Which is why he’s not surprised at the bubble of hope rising in his chest, only at the fact that it’s so small. “Father,” Arthur says, stepping forward, “I’m so glad you could make it.” “Nonsense.” Uther’s voice is sharp, and Arthur is abruptly thrown back to his years of high school and university, as well as the two he spent working for his father, when he would wait for Uther’s judgement, hoping for praise and almost inevitably receiving an angry tirade. “I’m not here to deliver my congratulations.” “Oh?” Arthur is astonished to find that the nonchalance in his voice reflects the one he actually feels. “Your little charade is over, I’ve tolerated it long enough.” “I hardly think ‘tolerated’ is an apt descriptor,” Morgana cuts in icily. Merlin appears by Arthur’s side and squeezes his hand. “Silence!” Uther snaps. He’s going a bit red in the face. “Arthur, you have demonstrated an utter incapacity to think of either social propriety or your future. If you cease conforming to this ridiculous, disgusting fad of homosexuality immediately, I am prepared to forgive you and work to find you a suitable match.” Arthur’s tongue seems to be stuck to the roof of his mouth. Everyone else is rooted to the spot in shock. Hunith is the first to recover. “You will not speak to Arthur in this way,” she says, stepping between them. Arthur realises he’s never seen Hunith truly angry before, but she certainly is now, face pale and fists clenched, her voice loud and firm. “And who might you be, to tell me how to address my own son?” Uther sneers. Hunith draws herself up. “His future mother-in-law.” “Clearly your son has corrupted you as well as Arthur.” Arthur thinks Hunith might explode. “If you ever paid one moment of attention to Arthur as a person, instead of an asset, you would see that he is the happiest he’s ever been. And if you were someone worthy of the title of ‘parent’, that would be enough. Instead you storm into an event meant as a celebration of Arthur and Merlin’s love and try to invalidate it, you make a scene, all in the name of supposed ‘social propriety’, when in fact you’re the most improper person in this room! You’re the one spouting outdated views that have only ever caused people harm, alienating your own son when all you should be concerned with is his well-being. You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Uther Pendragon.” Uther opens and closes his mouth soundlessly. He’s flushed, his hair and suit in disarray. Physically, he towers over Hunith, but alone, at a loss facing everyone in the room, he looks small. Arthur’s heart is racing, but he finds that he feels safe. Safe, and loved. So this is what it’s like to have a parent’s unconditional support . Arthur takes a moment to collect himself. “Father, I’m going to have to ask you to leave.” He takes a deep breath, and finds that the words he’s been wanting to say for years no longer get stuck in his throat. “You are not welcome in mine and Merlin’s life.” Leon and Percy escort Uther out the door. It closes with a satisfying click. “I’m sorry for my outburst, Arthur.” It’s Hunith. “I don’t know what came over me, it wasn’t really my place, I just couldn’t stand to hear him say those things to you—” Arthur pulls her into a hug. “Of course it was your place. You’re family.” Merlin embraces Arthur as soon as he releases Hunith. “That was so brave of you, love.” “I finally did it,” Arthur says, laughing softly past the tears in his eyes. He had imagined this moment countless times over the years. In his mind it had always entailed a shouting match between him and Uther, where he reiterated that Merlin was the love of his life and nothing could ever change that, then told his father to lose his phone number and stormed out of the house. But Arthur doesn’t owe Uther an explanation and this, somehow, was so much more fitting – to have Uther alone and falling apart while Arthur was surrounded by friends. By family. Arthur takes a deep breath and pulls away from Merlin. “I’m okay.” Merlin places a gentle hand on Arthur’s cheek, examining him. “You actually are, aren’t you?” he says, a bit of wonder in his tone. “You know, I’d forgotten I’d even invited him to the party. And right before he arrived, I was thinking about how happy I was that everyone I care about and consider family was here. I didn’t even think about him today until he showed up. I think…I think I’ll always be a bit sad, but…I was ready.” “I am so proud of you, Arthur, you have no idea.” Arthur smiles and turns toward the rest of the room, where all their friends are standing in awkward silence. “Anyone for champagne?” he asks.</span> <a href="#" class="summary-toggle">[ + ]</a></div><div class="stats"><div class="stat-item"><strong>Rating:</strong> Teen And Up Audiences</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Archive Warning:</strong> No Archive Warnings Apply</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Category:</strong> M/M</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Fandom:</strong> Merlin (TV)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Relationship:</strong> Merlin/Arthur Pendragon (Merlin), Merlin &amp; Morgana (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Character:</strong> Merlin (Merlin), Arthur Pendragon (Merlin), Morgana (Merlin), Uther Pendragon (Merlin), Hunith (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Additional Tags:</strong> Alternate Universe - Modern Setting, Established Relationship, Engagement Party, Homophobia, Fluff and Angst, Families of Choice</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Published:</strong> 2020-07-23</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Words:</strong> 1668</div></div></div><div class="work-entry"><h2 class="title"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://download.archiveofourown.org/downloads/24998170/i%20wish%20you%20would%20walk.pdf?updated_at=1593528668" target="_blank">i wish you would walk with me out into the world</a></h2><div class="summary"><span class="summary-short">Nine years after their breakup, a chance meeting brings Arthur and Merlin back together.

Notes quick story because i am a sucker for getting back together fics title is from mary oliver&#x27;s &quot;milkweed&quot; as ever, i do not own any of these characters. thanks for reading! Though Gwaine’s new flat was on the second floor, Merlin heard the welcome bustle of the housewarming party (Gwaine had insisted that “flat-warming” wasn’t a word) from the bottom of the stairs. Not bothering to knock, Merlin slipped in to the already-familiar flat. He had helped Gwaine move in, but it had still taken the man two months to get the place to an acceptable condition to host a housewarming party, and another six weeks to get around to actually inviting people. Merlin had taken the fact that Gwaine had needed over three months to organise a party – one that started as early as 7pm – as a true harbinger of old age. Noticing Gwaine in the kitchen, Merlin made his way over. “I brought wine,” he said in lieu of greeting, setting the bottle on the counter. “Good man, Merlin!” Gwaine clapped him on the shoulder. Merlin heard a strangled cough and realised he had interrupted a conversation. Gwaine, excellent host that he was, immediately sought to smoothly remedy the situation. “Not sure if you’ve met Arthur, Merlin,” he said, taking a step back so the two could see each other. Merlin froze, incredulous. Arthur Pendragon had changed since the last time Merlin had seen him, nearly a decade ago, when Merlin had decided he’d had enough and walked out of Arthur’s life. Arthur had grown out his hair a bit, and he was wearing jeans and a t-shirt instead of those godawful khakis and button-downs he used to sport to casual functions. And he’d aged, like they all had. But it was definitely Arthur. They stared at each other. It was Gwaine’s turn to cough. “I take it you two are already acquainted, then.” Merlin glanced at Gwaine, then lifted his chin in Arthur’s direction. A challenge, but also a concession – no matter what the past held, Arthur’s secrets were not Merlin’s to divulge. Arthur cleared his throat. “We dated. In uni. For about two years.” Gwaine raised his eyebrows, but he didn’t seem unduly shocked. Which, Merlin inferred, meant that Arthur wasn’t playing his straight-as-a-beanpole game anymore. Interesting. “Ah,” Gwaine said after a long, pregnant pause, in which it became clear that neither Arthur nor Merlin would volunteer any more information. “Well, I’ll leave you two to catch up. Or avoid each other all night. As you wish.” He flashed them a grin, then disappeared to greet new arrivals. Arthur swirled his rum and coke around in his glass. Chatter and music filled the flat, but to Merlin, the ice cubes clinking in Arthur’s drink were the loudest sounds in the room. Eager for something to do, Merlin grabbed a beer from the counter and made a show of uncapping it slowly. He put the bottle opener back down with a click. “So,” Arthur said, and Merlin nearly jumped out of his skin. “How have you been?” “You mean you haven’t drunkenly stalked me on Facebook recently?” Arthur huffed out a surprised laugh, and fuck , that smile of his was just as gorgeous as it had always been. Merlin took a sip of his beer. “I’ve been alright. Good, actually. Had to move back to Ealdor for a while a few years ago. Mum got breast cancer and needed someone to look after her.” “I’m sorry,” Arthur said gently. And he really looked it – Hunith had always been kind to him, even though he hadn’t wanted to tell even her about his and Merlin’s relationship. Merlin shrugged. “Thanks. She made full recovery, though, so I’m back in the city, still working at the hospital. Transferred out of A&amp;E. I’m a surgical nurse, now. Better hours.” There was a pause during which Arthur nodded and Merlin very deliberately did not mention many other things that had happened since they’d last seen one another. Then Merlin said, “You?” Arthur swirled his drink again. “I’m good as well. I, uh, I came out to my father. About five years ago.” “How’d that go?” Merlin meant for his tone to be teasing, but he wasn’t sure he succeeded. “About as badly as it could’ve gone. He vowed never to speak to me again.” “Shit.” “Yeah. I was half-expecting it, though. It was still hard, obviously, but…” Arthur didn’t meet Merlin’s gaze. “Listen, Merlin…I don’t mean to open up an old can of worms, but you were right, all those years ago. I was miserable, working for my father, pretending to be someone else just to make him happy. If you hadn’t pointed it out to me, I might never have had the guts to do anything about it, even if it did take me three years to get around to it. And…even though I wish I still had my father, I’m the happiest I’ve ever been, now. So I guess what I’m trying to say is thanks for knocking some sense into me, and I’m sorry for not listening to you when I should have.” Merlin could feel his heart hammering. He smiled. “I’m glad you’re happy, Arthur.” Gwaine, Leon, and Percy chose that exact moment to come bursting into the kitchen, loudly arguing about football. Merlin didn’t see Arthur again all evening. ___________________________________ “So, let’s recap,” Gwen said at brunch two weeks later. “When you broke up with Arthur just after uni, you were still in love with him.” “Yes.” Merlin pushed his eggs and potatoes around on his plate. “But you don’t regret your decision.” “No! I was miserable, but I would’ve been even more miserable if I’d been Arthur’s hidden side relationship like he wanted me to be. He idolized his father and was ready to do anything to make that dickhead happy. I just couldn’t!” Merlin felt like he was twenty-three again, explaining one of the worst days of his life to Gwen over a very similar brunch. Just as she had been then, Gwen was relentless: “So now you run into Arthur for the first time since then, because apparently he’s friends with Gwaine, and you realise you still have feelings for him.” “Yeah.” Merlin bowed his head, frustrated. It had taken him much too long to get over Arthur, but he was over him now, had been for years, and suddenly the guy came waltzing back into his life for ten minutes and Merlin couldn’t get him out of his head. “But,” Gwen pressed, “When you run into him, he’s changed. He tells you that you were right and he apologizes.” “Yes.” “Which is exactly what you hoped he would say when you broke up with him.” “Yes.” “I therefore fail to see a problem.” Merlin looked up in surprise. “What?” Gwen’s tone was gentle. “Don’t what me, love, it’s obvious. You need to call Arthur, tell him you still have feelings, and see if he wants to rekindle the relationship. I’ll text Gwaine right now to get Arthur’s number.” “No! Don’t even think about it!” Merlin was going for playful, but it came out more on the panicky side. Gwen must have noticed, as she lowered her phone and looked at him with concern. “What’s wrong, Merlin? Just the other day you were saying you wanted to think about settling down, and all of a sudden here comes someone who you already have feelings for, who says exactly what you wanted him to say. Just call him, what have you got to lose?” “Only my heart,” Merlin said miserably. “Drama queen.” Gwen looked like she was trying very hard not to laugh. “It’s not funny!” “It was a little bit.” “Fine,” Merlin relented, giving in to his urge to smile. “But seriously. Both of my long-term relationships have ended with me being head-over-heels in love with someone who doesn’t value me, who I have to pluck up the courage to break up with, and who it takes me way too long to get over. I don’t want that to happen again, and it just seems like asking for it to try and get back together with one of the previous culprits.” Gwen squeezed Merlin’s hand. “You’re right. I never want to see you heartbroken like that again.” Merlin was about rejoice at her dropping the subject, when she added: “Will you regret it if you don’t call Arthur?” Merlin sighed. “Probably.” ___________________________________ Merlin lay on top of his bedsheets two days later, after a grueling shift at the hospital, his finger hovering over the call button. He’d typed Arthur’s number in as soon as Gwen had forwarded it to him, but he hadn’t gone any further yet. He still wasn’t certain that he should. Looking around his darkened room, Merlin considered how nice it would be to have someone to come home to who could give him a shoulder rub. He pressed call. Arthur picked up on the first ring. “Hello?” “Hi, Arthur. It’s Merlin. I, uh, I got your number from Gwaine.” “Ah, Merlin! To what do I owe the pleasure?” Arthur sounded casual enough, but Merlin could tell he was surprised. “Um,” Merlin said. He really hadn’t thought this far ahead. “Well, as you said, I don’t necessarily want to open an old can of worms, so feel free to just refuse and we can go back to not speaking to one another…” Merlin felt his throat tighten. “But…after the party at Gwaine’s, I kind of realised that I still have feelings for you. Of a sort. So I thought…I dunno, you’ve changed, I’ve changed, maybe we could grab lunch or coffee sometime and see where it goes? If you want.” Merlin waited. On the other end of the line, Arthur breathed in deeply. Still Merlin waited. At last Arthur said thickly, “I’d like that. I’d really like that.” ___________________________________ Merlin leaned back onto the sofa’s cushions and breathed deeply, wiping tears of laughter from his eyes. He kicked playfully at Arthur, who scooted forward so he was seated between Merlin’s legs, facing him. Since their first lunch date two months ago, they had tacitly avoided wandering too far down memory lane. Whatever their relationship was had been going surprisingly smoothly, and Merlin, for his part, hadn’t wanted to bring up anything that might kindle an argument. But today they had somehow begun reminiscing about a particularly memorable episode involving Arthur’s sister Morgana, Merlin’s great-uncle Gaius, and a much too posh restaurant, and that mention of the past had gone astonishingly well. They sat catching their breath until Arthur placed his hands on Merlin’s knees and said, “You know, Merlin, while we’re on the topic of the past,” and Merlin’s heart clenched. He knew it was inevitable; they would have to unpack the reasons why their previous relationship hadn’t worked if they ever wanted this one to go anywhere, but now ? Arthur pushed onward, oblivious, “I didn’t want to say at first because it would make me seem weird and creepy, but I think you should know…I never really got over you.” “And admitting it now as opposed to a month ago is supposed to make you seem less weird and creepy?” Merlin teased, though his heart wasn’t in it. “Shut up, I’m trying to be sappy.” Merlin scooped Arthur’s hands up from where they had been resting on his knees and began absentmindedly playing with them to distract himself from his increasing nerves. “Anyway,” Arthur added, “What I’m trying to say is…I know I said this at Gwaine’s when we first met again, but I wanted to reiterate how sorry I am for the way I acted when we broke up…how sorry I am we broke up at all. You were right about everything: that I’d be miserable if I kept living a lie, that my father was manipulating me, that I took you for granted. Not valuing you enough, not listening to you, letting you go…it’s my biggest regret.” Merlin’s hands stilled, and he stared and his and Arthur’s entwined fingers, just breathing for a moment. He felt he might be in danger of either melting into the couch or floating away through the ceiling – once again Arthur was saying exactly what Merlin had wished he would say. Eventually Merlin managed: “You know, what you call ‘being sappy’ most people just call proper communication with their partner.” “I just poured my heart out to you, and that’s what you say?” Merlin laughed softly, then brought Arthur’s hands to his mouth, kissing the knuckles. “I don’t regret our breakup.” Arthur tensed, and Merlin backpedalled, “Wait! What I mean is I think you needed time. We both did. You weren’t ready to see the shortcomings in our relationship, and I don’t think you were ready to come out to your dad either. I was impatient and I didn’t really know where I was going in life. If we’d had to deal with your father’s bad parenting and my mum’s illness together and at the same time, I don’t think our relationship would’ve survived. I think we found each other again at the perfect moment.” Arthur smiled, that gorgeous smile that had had Merlin spellbound from the very first day. “Once again, you’re absolutely right.” “Better get used to it.” Arthur crawled forward, leaning over Merlin, his smile turning suggestive. “Does that imply you’re going to stick around long enough for it to become a regular occurrence?” Merlin thought of Arthur’s apology, how wonderful these past two months had been, his smile. As he pulled Arthur down for a kiss, Merlin found himself saying, “I think it does.”</span> <a href="#" class="summary-toggle">[ + ]</a></div><div class="stats"><div class="stat-item"><strong>Rating:</strong> General Audiences</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Archive Warning:</strong> No Archive Warnings Apply</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Category:</strong> M/M</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Fandom:</strong> Merlin (TV)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Relationship:</strong> Merlin/Arthur Pendragon (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Character:</strong> Merlin (Merlin), Arthur Pendragon (Merlin), Gwaine (Merlin), Gwen (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Additional Tags:</strong> Romance, Getting Back Together, Implied/Referenced Homophobia, References to Illness, Gwaine is an unintentional wingman</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Published:</strong> 2020-06-30</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Words:</strong> 2253</div></div></div><div class="work-entry"><h2 class="title"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://download.archiveofourown.org/downloads/7920472/lets%20destroy%20each.pdf?updated_at=1473938327" target="_blank">let&#x27;s destroy each mistake that we made</a></h2><div class="summary"><span class="summary-short">One shattered mug and a slammed door later, Arthur is left to deal with the aftermath of their first fight.

Notes I never anticipated making this a series, but I fell so in love with the Arthur/Girl!Merlin dynamic and, well, here I am! Title taken from &quot;Fake It&quot; by Bastille. See the end of the work for more notes ••• The thing about fights with Merlin is that by the end of them, Arthur can&#x27;t remember what had got them arguing in the first place. Usually it was something stupid like leaving the toilet seat up or using the wrong toothbrush or finding hair in the shower. But none of it really ended up mattering because they always made amends the same way—a mumbled apology, a forgiving kiss, and enthusiastic make-up sex. This time, though, is different. Because standing in the middle of their kitchen, hands on his hips, breathing loudly through his nose, and staring at the front door Merlin had slammed shut before storming off not even a minute ago, Arthur knows exactly how this fight got started. Predictably, it&#x27;s all his fault. He had been working on his thesis presentation and Merlin had been making a cup of tea and the next thing Arthur knew, there was a shattered mug and tea all over the kitchen floor and a lot of yelling, mostly from him. Arthur feels all the anger drain out of him like a punctured hot air balloon, replaced instead by bitter, gut-twisting guilt as he recalls all the awful things he had said to Merlin—calling her a klutz and a bumbling fool and a few other names that would&#x27;ve made Morgana disembowel him and then castrate him with his own innards. He hadn&#x27;t meant any of it, of course. The combined stress and lack of sleep had given him a particularly short fuse, and any little thing was bound to set him off—it just so happened that Merlin dropping the mug was like a match to a kerosene lamp and he had, well, blown up (literally). Not that it was any excuse. Arthur knows that. He&#x27;d known it then, too, when Merlin had tried apologizing and he&#x27;d snapped at her instead. Remembering the hurt in her eyes makes something deep inside his chest hurt, like someone&#x27;s just run him through with a jagged knife and keeps twisting it round and round. Arthur had realized how badly he&#x27;d fucked up, but it had been too late—because just like that, Merlin was lifting her chin, soft features turning to stone, and grabbing her jacket before heading out the door. But even as she had turned to glare at him over her shoulder, Arthur could see the heartbreak shining in her over-expressive eyes, red and watery. Arthur presses his hand to his sternum, rubbing the pressure there, willing it to go away because it was getting hard to breathe. God, he had really fucked this up. Arthur shoots up to his feet, chair scraping nosily on the kitchen floor. Before his brain even has a chance to process what he&#x27;s doing, he&#x27;s dialed Merlin&#x27;s number and has his mobile pressed to his ear, heart juddering in his chest, muttering, &quot;Come on, come on, come on, pick up...&quot; She doesn&#x27;t. The phone goes straight to voicemail. Arthur tries three more times and leaves a message during his final attempt. &quot;Merlin, it&#x27;s me. Can we talk? I didn&#x27;t mean— I wish I didn&#x27;t— Look, Merlin, I know I acted like a total arsehole and that you had every right to leave, but I... God, I&#x27;m shit at this. Merlin, will you come home? Please?&quot; Please. ••• Arthur doesn&#x27;t realize he&#x27;s fallen asleep at his laptop until the loud roar of ambulance sirens jolts him awake with a gasp. He rubs at his eyes blearily and glances at the digital clock on the oven that reads 11:36 in glaring red; and then it hits him all at once, like a bucket of ice water poured down his shirt—the fight, the yelling, Merlin leaving. Merlin . Arthur reaches for his mobile, nearly dropping it in his hurry to check for any text messages or voicemails from Merlin. But there&#x27;s nothing from her, only a voicemail and a couple of texts from people who aren&#x27;t Merlin , so he ignores them. Arthur clears his notifications and pauses to stare at the lockscreen photo he took of Merlin last autumn, her face scrunched up in a laugh as she pulls an errant yellow leaf out of her ponytail. He doesn&#x27;t think about trying to call her again or the first draft of his presentation that&#x27;s due Monday or his Sunday brunch plans with Morgana, doesn&#x27;t think about anything that&#x27;s not different variations of the same thing: have to find Merlin now. Arthur grabs his hoodie from the closet just as another round of ambulance sirens start sounding in the distance and suddenly he feels sick to his stomach, just thoroughly awash with panic and fear because what if something&#x27;s happened to her ? Merlin doesn&#x27;t have her driver&#x27;s license and her bicycle is in the garage which means she was (or still is) walking alone in the dark; and as much as Merlin insists that she can take care of herself and has taken self-defense classes, there are all manner of creeps and depraved criminals out roaming the streets, just waiting for a girl who is alone to walk by. And Arthur would never, ever forgive himself if something happened to Merlin, if she got hurt or— Arthur is out the door before he even has a chance to finish the thought. ••• The commotion outside turns out to be a massive three-car accident that&#x27;s backed up incoming traffic on the main road, so Arthur has no choice but to set out running on foot, weaving his way through the throngs of onlookers crowded around the street corners. He zips up his hoodie and pulls the hood over his head, weighing his options. He could try getting in touch with Freya, but as sweet as she&#x27;s always been to him, she&#x27;s also fiercely overprotective of Merlin and Arthur isn&#x27;t ready to face the explosive wrath of someone so tiny yet lethal. There&#x27;s Gwaine, but he lives all the way across town so Arthur would have to take a cab just to get over there, which would be a huge waste of time (that, and Gwaine&#x27;s always had a painfully obvious crush on Merlin; and as petty as it sounds, Arthur really doesn&#x27;t want to deal with that right now). And as for Will—well, no. Arthur narrows it down to Gwen, who will undoubtedly give him her signature look of disapproval and make him feel like shit, but she won&#x27;t explode and he can actually count on her to be helpful. So that&#x27;s how Arthur finds himself knocking on Gwen&#x27;s tiny one-bedroom flat, sweaty and out of breath. But when the door opens, it&#x27;s not Gwen who answers it. It&#x27;s her boyfriend, Lance, blinking at him curiously. Arthur is suddenly all too aware of how he must look—he hasn&#x27;t showered since last night, his hair is a rumpled mess under his hood, and he has about two days&#x27; worth of too-long-to-be-stubble-but- too-short-to-be-a-beard on his face. Arthur stands up straighter, decidedly ignoring how put together Lance looks, even in his flannel pajama bottoms and UNICEF t-shirt. &quot;Arthur,&quot; he greets, flashing a warm smile and looking annoyingly pleasant for someone who&#x27;s just been woken up. &quot;Gwen was right. I guess you&#x27;re here for—&quot; &quot;Merlin is missing,&quot; Arthur cuts in, impatient and unapologetic as blind panic starts to seep in. &quot;We got into an argument hours ago and she just stormed off. I haven&#x27;t seen her since. She won&#x27;t answer my calls so I&#x27;ve no idea where she could be and I—&quot; His voice shakes. &quot;I&#x27;m so afraid something&#x27;s happened to her.&quot; &quot;Arthur—&quot; &quot;It was all my fault,&quot; Arthur goes on, pulling off his hood to rake his fingers through his hair. &quot;I lost my temper and I acted like a total prick. She had every right to—&quot; &quot;But, Arthur—&quot; &quot;—leave, but she should be back by now, and I called her four times on my way over and sent her maybe a dozen texts, but she&#x27;s not—&quot; &quot; Arthur ,&quot; he says firmly, &quot;she&#x27;s here.&quot; He continues babbling on the edge of hysteria for another second or two before Lance&#x27;s words finally register. Then he drops his hands to his sides and stares, mouth hanging open stupidly. &quot;Huh?&quot; Lance smiles patiently, though he looks very close to laughing. &quot;Merlin. She&#x27;s here.&quot; &quot;She&#x27;s...&quot; And as the adrenaline leaves him, Arthur feels like his legs have just turned to jelly and he sags against the door. &quot;You— You mean she&#x27;s been here &quot; he points to the ground &quot;all this time?&quot; &quot;I just got back from the soup kitchen&quot;—because, yes, of course Lance volunteered at a bloody soup kitchen—&quot;about an hour ago, but she was here at the time, yeah.&quot; &quot;Why didn&#x27;t anyone think to tell me?&quot; Arthur asks, more sharply than he&#x27;d intended. But Lance just regards him kindly, like he&#x27;s a stray pup that&#x27;s been found digging in the dumpster. &quot;Gwen said she did. She texted you and left you a voicemail.&quot; &quot;Oh God.&quot; Arthur closes his eyes. Embarrassed doesn&#x27;t even begin to describe how he feels. Heat creeps up the back of his neck. This whole ordeal could&#x27;ve been avoided if he&#x27;d just— &quot;I&#x27;ve fucked up big time, haven&#x27;t I?&quot; He means for it to be rhetorical, but Lance just claps his shoulder sympathetically. &quot;Happens to the best of us, mate. They do say love makes you do strange things,&quot; he says, stepping back and motioning for Arthur to come inside. &quot;Maybe go sort things out with her?&quot; He drops his voice to a whisper. &quot;She seems pretty upset.&quot; Arthur winces. &quot;Yeah,&quot; he says grimly. &quot;Listen, sorry for waking you and Gwen up and intruding like this.&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s no trouble,&quot; Lance says in that overly sincere way of his that would make Arthur suspicious if it was anyone else. &quot;Gwen reckoned you might be coming. She left an extra blanket for you two on the sofa.&quot; Arthur cracks a smile. &quot;An angel, that woman is.&quot; &quot;She really is,&quot; Lance agrees. The lovestruck look on his face makes Arthur glance away, feeling guilty and inept. Why couldn&#x27;t he be more like that when it came to Merlin? &quot;Sleep well,&quot; Lance says, patting his arm. &quot;And good luck,&quot; he adds, grinning encouragingly. Arthur snorts. &quot;Thanks. I&#x27;ll need it.&quot; He watches Lance leave and return to the bedroom before unzipping his hoodie and hanging it on the coat rack. He catches sight of himself in the small mirror by the entryway and combs his fingers through his hair haphazardly before realizing it&#x27;s useless and that he&#x27;s just stalling for time. Arthur takes a deep breath and takes a few steps forward, then turns the small corner into the living room. When he sees Merlin sitting on the sofa, with a huge tub of what looks like raspberry gelato in her lap, he&#x27;s equal parts relieved and nervous. Her damp hair is clipped back into a high messy bun and she&#x27;s wearing rubber ducky pajama bottoms (likely Gwen&#x27;s) and a huge pink t-shirt that reads STRESSED SPELLED BACKWARDS IS DESSERTS (definitely Gwen&#x27;s). Merlin must notice him, but she doesn&#x27;t even spare him a passing glance, her eyes glued to the television as she watches some not- Star Trek movie that&#x27;s got Chris Pine in it, a metal spoon shoved in her mouth. Arthur takes a few tentative steps towards the couch, then pulls off his trainers and sits down. There are a lot of things he could say—&quot;I&#x27;m sorry&quot; or &quot;I was so worried about you&quot; or even a simple hello. Instead, he blurts, &quot;You&#x27;ve, um, got some gelato in your hair.&quot; That gets her attention. Merlin&#x27;s eyes cut across sharply to his own; they&#x27;re red-rimmed and puffy, like she&#x27;s been crying for a long time. &quot;And you&#x27;ve got a bird or two living in that nest you call hair,&quot; she retorts, then proceeds to stab her spoon through the gelato. &quot;Haven&#x27;t you got a presentation to finish?&quot; Arthur watches her warily for a few more seconds, trying to gather his thoughts and find the right words—and by right he means something that won&#x27;t upset Merlin more than he already has. &quot;I know that I hurt you,&quot; he settles on tentatively. &quot;Figure that out all by yourself, did you?&quot; she snorts. &quot;Well done.&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m sorry,&quot; he rushes to say. &quot;I wasn&#x27;t thinking straight, I was tired and stressed—and I know that isn&#x27;t an excuse,&quot; he adds hastily when she opens her mouth, &quot;I know that didn&#x27;t give me the right to act like a massive dick. I don&#x27;t know what I was thinking—I probably wasn&#x27;t thinking, honestly— and as much as I want to, I can&#x27;t take back all those awful things I said to you, but I didn&#x27;t mean any of them. I&#x27;d never purposely hurt you, you know that, and I&#x27;m...I&#x27;m just so sorry , Merlin.&quot; Merlin is quiet as she looks away from him and down at the rapidly melting gelato. She stirs her spoon around in it, mashing the chunks into an unappealing soupy pink mixture. &quot;You should be,&quot; she mumbles. &quot;When you didn&#x27;t come back home, I was so afraid something had happened to you,&quot; Arthur says, closing his eyes and shaking his head at the thought. &quot;I know that I&#x27;m the idiot for not listening to Gwen&#x27;s voicemail, but I was in such a panic that I wasn&#x27;t thinking straight. I thought someone had —&quot; &quot;I can take care of myself,&quot; Merlin snaps, just like Arthur knew she would. &quot;I don&#x27;t need to be coddled.&quot; &quot;We&#x27;re dating and, believe it or not, I care about you,&quot; Arthur says, exasperated. &quot;Doesn&#x27;t that mean I&#x27;m allowed to worry about you, even a little bit?&quot; &quot;You have a funny way of showing it,&quot; Merlin murmurs. She pauses the movie, puts the gelato on the coffee table, and turns to face him, knee touching his thigh. &quot;Do you know what hurt the most?&quot; She presses her lips together and blinks rapidly, her eyelashes coming away wet. &quot;You... You didn&#x27;t even try to stop me from leaving.&quot; Arthur doesn&#x27;t even know what to say, too overcome with that familiar bitter feeling of shame, regret, and ineptitude. Here he is, about to make Merlin cry again, and what does that say about him? For not the first time, he feels undeserving of her, Will&#x27;s snarled &quot;you&#x27;re just a prissy spoiled brat&quot; loud and clear in his ears. He slumps back against the couch, rubbing his eyes hard with the heels of his palms. &quot;I&#x27;m...bad at this. It would almost be comical if it wasn&#x27;t so fucking pathetic.&quot; He huffs out a laugh. &quot;But I guess old habits die hard, especially when you were raised by a man who thought emotions signified weakness. Holding it all in until it kills you or you develop a bleeding ulcer, whichever comes first—that&#x27;s the Pendragon way.&quot; Arthur chuckles humorlessly. When he finally chances a glance at Merlin, she looks deeply sad— sadder than he&#x27;s ever seen her, sadder than should be allowed. And it&#x27;s all because of him, he realizes a painful heartbeat later, watching Merlin fold her arms around herself. He&#x27;s the one making her look that way, feel that way. &quot;I&#x27;m never going to be Lance or Gwaine or,&quot; he gestures carelessly to the television, &quot;Chris Pine, or whoever else it is that you fancy. I&#x27;m only ever going to be Arthur. And I know that&#x27;s never going to be good enough because you deserve so much better. But I can only ever be me, with my short temper and my tendency to get jealous over stupid things and the insecurities I&#x27;m embarrassed to admit.&quot; His face heats just confessing that. &quot;But I want you to know that...even if it doesn&#x27;t seem like it because I&#x27;m always cocking it up, I&#x27;m trying to be better, to be the person that you deserve— and I want to keep trying. For you. For us, Merlin.&quot; His voice cracks. &quot;And I&#x27;m so sorry I let you leave like that when all I wanted was for you to stay.&quot; Arthur stares down at his hands, which at some point had curled into fists, skin stretched taut over his knuckles. He can&#x27;t bring himself to look at Merlin in the eyes again, and he&#x27;s preparing himself for the worst—for Merlin to call off things between them, tell him that she&#x27;s moving out at the end of this term because she can&#x27;t deal with someone so emotionally stunted and boxed in on himself. It wouldn&#x27;t be the first time, either. It&#x27;s the same reason why none of his past relationships had ever panned out; he would screw up somehow, inevitably, and she would call it quits. Even someone as patient as Mithian couldn&#x27;t handle all his blunders. So it comes as a surprise when Merlin reaches out and places her hand atop his own, fingers loosening his fist and slipping against his palm, making his breath catch in his throat. Merlin scoots closer so she&#x27;s almost halfway in his lap and rests her other hand on his cheek, then flicks his ear when he doesn&#x27;t look at her. &quot;You&#x27;re stupid,&quot; she says after he finally looks up, a faint smile on her lips. &quot;So very stupid.&quot; &quot;Add that to my list of faults,&quot; he grumbles, genuinely hurt. &quot;Arthur,&quot; she tries, softer this time. Her hand grasps the back of his neck, thumb stroking his nape soothingly. &quot;I just meant... How could you possibly think that I want you to be someone else? I don&#x27;t want you to be Lance or Gwaine. And as for Chris Pine, well...&quot; She sighs forlornly and Arthur&#x27;s mouth twitches, an aborted smile. &quot;I can live, I suppose.&quot; &quot;How charitable of you.&quot; Merlin&#x27;s answering smile is fleeting. &quot;If I wanted someone else, then I would&#x27;ve broken up with you a long time ago. I don&#x27;t waste my time,&quot; she says seriously. &quot;But you, Arthur Pendragon, even with your many faults and your...&quot; She pauses to consider. &quot;Pratitude?&quot; he supplies. &quot;I was going to say &#x27;dollopheadedness,&#x27; but pratitude works too,&quot; she agrees brightly. Arthur just shakes his head at her, fond. &quot;But even with all that,&quot; she continues, &quot;I know there&#x27;s something genuine about you. I see glimpses of it, like that time you stopped on the side of the road to rescue a lost puppy, or walked to the library in the pouring rain just to make sure I had an umbrella.&quot; Merlin squeezes his hand. &quot;There will never be another like you, Arthur. I don&#x27;t want anyone else.&quot; The heavy lump that settles in his throat makes it nearly impossible to speak. His eyes sting hot and begin to water, vision blurring along the edges. &quot;Merlin, I&#x27;m...&quot; When she puts her arms around him, folding him in, Arthur freezes. It never fails to surprise him just how freely Merlin hugs people, just like her mother. Arthur wonders, however briefly, what it would feel like to have a parent like Hunith, someone there to hug you whenever you needed it. He might even be a little jealous if he wasn&#x27;t so sad already. Once he recovers, Arthur sits up and hugs her back tightly, face turned into her neck and nose pressed to her hair. &quot;I&#x27;m sorry,&quot; he chokes out. &quot;I&#x27;m so, so sorry, Merlin.&quot; &quot;Shh.&quot; Merlin combs her fingers through the short strands of hair at his nape. &quot;I know you are, prat.&quot; He&#x27;s not sure if he just imagines the kiss brushed to his temple. Some time later, Merlin pulls back and takes his face in her hands, thumbing away the wetness beneath his eyes. She looks him over for a long moment before the edge of her mouth lifts up in a tiny, affectionate smile. &quot;You look like hell,&quot; she says, not unkindly. &quot;I feel like hell,&quot; Arthur sighs, eyes drooping shut as he leans into the cool touch of her hands. The temptation to just fall asleep with her in his lap is strong, but... &quot;Do you forgive me?&quot; he asks, uncertain in the way his voice shakes. Merlin doesn&#x27;t answer his question. Instead, she kisses the corner of his lips—a barely there, butterfly touch that makes Arthur grab hold of her elbow to draw her back in for a proper one on the mouth, slow and searching. Merlin keeps one hand on his chest and the other goes to his shoulder as she shifts up on her knees, angling her head down to better kiss him. She slants her mouth against his, opens it, and Arthur tastes the tart-sweetness of raspberries and chocolate on her tongue. Suddenly, sleeping is the last thing on his mind. Merlin breaks the kiss with a soft peck to his mouth and smiles down at him in that mischievous way he knows all too well. &quot;I, um...&quot; Arthur finds it difficult to formulate words when his head feels like its been stuffed full of cotton. &quot;I take it you forgive me, then?&quot; Merlin idly wraps a strand of his hair around her finger. &quot;You&#x27;ve a lot of making up to do before I forgive you,&quot; she tells him, looking at him significantly. Arthur strokes his hands up and down her back, pleased when he discovers she&#x27;s not wearing a bra under her t-shirt, just like at home. He reaches up and removes the large clip holding her hair in place, letting it tumble down her narrow shoulders the way he likes best. He plants a kiss to the soft, smooth skin of her jaw and throws the hair clip aside carelessly. &quot;Where should I start?&quot; he husks. &quot;Lie down and you&#x27;ll find out,&quot; she teases, pushing him away. As Merlin moves off his lap, Arthur lies down willingly, eagerly enough that she bites her lip and shakes her head, clearly holding back laughter. Although Merlin is many things, predictable isn&#x27;t one of them—but of all the things Arthur braces himself for, Merlin coming to lie down on top of him with her head tucked under his chin is not one of them. &quot;... What .&quot; &quot;What?&quot; Merlin asks around a yawn. &quot;Oh my God, you actually thought—?&quot; She kicks his leg with her foot. &quot;Arthur, do you think I&#x27;m depraved enough to have sex with you in Gwen&#x27;s living room?&quot; &quot;Do you want an honest answer or a— Ow!&quot; he hisses, as Merlin yanks at strands of his chest hair, huffing. &quot;I can&#x27;t believe you!&quot; she scolds. &quot;We are not shagging on her sofa like a pair of horny teenagers!&quot; &quot;It wouldn&#x27;t be the first time!&quot; Arthur insists. &quot;Remember when we visited my dad for the weekend?&quot; &quot;That was different,&quot; Merlin sniffs. &quot;I did it as a favor to you.&quot; Arthur scoffs. &quot;Really?&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; she says pointedly. &quot;I did it so that every time you visit him from now on, you&#x27;ll see that armchair and remember me riding your dick while Uther was in his study down the hall. It&#x27;ll make your stays without me much more bearable.&quot; His cheeks heat at the memory of Merlin squirming in his lap, one hand clamped over his mouth and the other shoved between her legs, mouth at his ear, panting, &quot;Quiet, Arthur, or your daddy will hear us.&quot; He doesn&#x27;t think that will make visiting his father more bearable at all. In fact, he envisions a lot of long, sleepless nights spent wanking in his bed. &quot;That was my dad&#x27;s armchair, Merlin,&quot; Arthur laments. &quot;I know,&quot; she replies smugly. Arthur rolls his eyes. &quot;Besides,&quot; Merlin adds like an afterthought, letting the movie play again as Arthur reaches over his head for the blanket, unfolds it, and throws it over them both. &quot;What I have in mind for you requires more room than a sofa will permit.&quot; Arthur&#x27;s mouth goes dry, his blood instantly rushing south. &quot;Are you trying to make me hard?&quot; Merlin shifts, throwing one leg over his own so she&#x27;s straddling his thigh—which, of course, just adds to the problem. &quot;Ah,&quot; she acknowledges, cheeky. &quot;It&#x27;s working.&quot; &quot;You&#x27;re going to be the death of me,&quot; he accuses. &quot;Death by blue balls,&quot; she says, and starts giggling like she&#x27;s just made a fantastic joke. &quot;Imagine the coroner&#x27;s report!&quot; She buries her face in his neck and laughs and laughs, her whole body shaking with it. Arthur sighs exasperatedly, but strokes his hand through her hair anyway, waiting for her to calm down. At one point the muffled sounds of her laughter become too much and elicit a snort out of him, followed by a chuckle, and then suddenly he&#x27;s laughing too; so the pair of them lie there like that, red-faced and laughing about nothing. After some time, Merlin eventually quiets and turns her face back towards the movie. Arthur watches her for a few minutes, at how the light plays over her skin and the way she crinkles her nose to get rid of an apparent itch. Something heavy settles in the pit of his stomach, churning uneasily and making the smile fade from his face. &quot;That was our first real fight.&quot; Merlin stiffens almost imperceptibly. &quot;Yeah,&quot; she says in a small voice that&#x27;s nothing like her. &quot;S&#x27;pose it was.&quot; Arthur swallows, hesitating. &quot;I imagine there will be more,&quot; he goes on. &quot;Fights are inevitable in any relationship, no matter how strong.&quot; &quot;You&#x27;re right,&quot; she says calmly, but her hand on his arm squeezes a little. Arthur wonders if she even realizes it. &quot;I&#x27;m going to try and be better,&quot; he promises her. &quot;But I&#x27;m not — not perfect, and I know somewhere down the line I&#x27;m bound to slip up and say more things that I don&#x27;t mean, things that will probably hurt you.&quot; Arthur tightens his arms around her, wishing he could apologize for all of his future mistakes right now. &quot;But if that happens, I just want you to remember what&#x27;s most important to me.&quot; Merlin leans up on her elbow and looks at him in the eye. &quot;What&#x27;s that?&quot; she asks, looking genuinely puzzled. Arthur shakes his head, smiling. &quot;I&#x27;m looking at her.&quot; It comes as a pleasant surprise when Merlin glances away shyly, her cheeks reddening. The smile she gifts him is soft and private, just her two front teeth peeking out as she dimples, eyes twinkling. It&#x27;s the kind of smile that makes his heart beat faster and pulse race, the kind he desperately wants to take a picture of but will have to settle for just remembering in stunning clarity and detail. Merlin plants a tender kiss to his cheek, just below his eye, and Arthur smiles so hard his eyes crinkle. She settles back down against his chest with a content little hum as his arms wind back around her. &quot;You&#x27;re such a huge romantic sap,&quot; she accuses, not sounding displeased. &quot;It&#x27;s one of my more endearing qualities.&quot; &quot;So it is,&quot; she agrees sleepily. Arthur waits for Merlin to fall asleep before switching off the movie, bidding a silent but salty goodbye to Chris Pine. Sleep starts pulling him under as soon as the room is blanketed in darkness and Arthur&#x27;s attempt at stifling his yawn backfires, Merlin snuffling and mumbling a little in her sleep. He has a presentation due in a day and an apology text to send Morgana in the morning and will probably wake up with a horrible crick in his neck, but none of that really matters right now. Because the only thing that does is fast asleep in his arms. ••• End Notes Thank you for reading! :) x</span> <a href="#" class="summary-toggle">[ + ]</a></div><div class="stats"><div class="stat-item"><strong>Rating:</strong> Teen And Up Audiences</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Archive Warning:</strong> No Archive Warnings Apply</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Category:</strong> F/M</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Fandom:</strong> Merlin (TV)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Relationship:</strong> Merlin/Arthur Pendragon (Merlin), Gwen/Lancelot (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Character:</strong> Merlin (Merlin), Arthur Pendragon (Merlin), Lancelot (Merlin), Gwen (Merlin)</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Additional Tags:</strong> Genderswap, Girl!Merlin, Alternate Universe - College/University, Established Relationship, Fights &amp; Make Ups, Angst, Tooth-Rotting Fluff</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Series:</strong> Part 2 of Easiest When I&#x27;m With You</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Published:</strong> 2016-09-15</div><div class="stat-item"><strong>Words:</strong> 4568</div></div></div><div class="work-entry"><h2 class="title"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://download.archiveofourown.org/downloads/7395706/my%20days%20with%20you%20are.pdf?updated_at=1492429164" target="_blank">my days with you are brighter than sunflowers</a></h2><div class="summary"><span class="summary-short">arthur is a nurse on forced leave and merlin&#x27;s a kissogram-turned- literature-professor about to be late for work and doctor who does not exist, but somehow their oven is the tardis Notes i had this image of the two of them as the ponds and it made me want to cry (somewhere, in a village called ealdor, in an alternate london where doctor who does not exist) &quot;Merls?&quot; Arthur called out</span><span class="summary-long" style="display:none;">arthur is a nurse on forced leave and merlin&#x27;s a kissogram-turned- literature-professor about to be late for work and doctor who does not exist, but somehow their oven is the tardis Notes i had this image of the two of them as the ponds and it made me want to cry (somewhere, in a village called ealdor, in an alternate london where doctor who does not exist) &quot;Merls?&quot; Arthur called out sleepily, stumbling into the kitchen, one sunny morning. &quot;Merlin?&quot; He had woken up to a lack of bed covers, and, perhaps, more importantly- a lack of Merlin by his side. &quot;Over here!&quot; Merlin called back, crouched by their much abused, blue oven. (It had a rectangular, yellow-white lightbulb on the top for decoration, along with for some reason, vinyl stickers that read &quot;Police&quot;, and, &quot;Pull To Open&quot; stuck to the oven door.) He was oddly enough-- poking it with a whisk. &quot;I think our oven&#x27;s broken.&quot; &quot;Really?&quot; Arthur yawned, bending over to inspect it. Upon finding no fault in it, he shrugged. &quot;Maybe it got tired last night. You baked a /lot/ of cookies.&quot; &quot;And /you/ ate a lot of them.&quot; He retorted, poking Arthur&#x27;s stomach. Arthur bats his hand away. &quot;I did not.&quot; Arthur denied vehemently, his pink cheeks giving him away. &quot;Mmhm.&quot; Merlin raises an eyebrow, glasses slipping down his nose. &quot;Sure.&quot; &quot;I might&#x27;ve... had.. a couple...-&quot; &quot;A couple is like five pieces, you had ei--&quot; Arthur groans loudly, cutting him off. &quot;Shut up, /Mer/lin.&quot; Merlin grins brightly, giving Arthur&#x27;s tummy another poke. &quot;No, don&#x27;t think I will.&quot; Arthur snorts, before wrapping his arms around Merlin&#x27;s waist and tugging him close for a quick kiss. Merlin puts a hand at the nape of Arthur&#x27;s neck, kissing him back eagerly, before pulling away with a sigh. &quot;You&#x27;re going to make me late for work.&quot; &quot;Oh? I wasn&#x27;t aware that a kissogram had hours.&quot; Merlin snacks his shoulder playfully. &quot;Ass. you know that I don&#x27;t do that anymore.&quot; He rolls his eyes. Arthur chuckles &quot;I know, I know-- /Professor/ Emrys.&quot; He drawled the last two words, making Merlin smirk. &quot;You just love saying that, don&#x27;t you?&quot; &quot;What? my fiance is a sexy, literature professor-- it&#x27;s kinda hot.&quot; &quot;You&#x27;re a nerd.&quot; merlin shoots back, but there&#x27;s a fond smile curving his lips. &quot;Ah, but you love me.&quot; &quot;Unfortunately, I do.&quot; Merlin pretends to sigh deeply. &quot;You little sh--&quot; Arthur pokes Merlin&#x27;s side sharply. Nerlin lets out a yelp, poking him back, and the two end up rolling on the floor in an impromptu tickle fight. (Arthur wins.) &quot;But i do love you, though,&quot; merlin says breathlessly to Arthur, who&#x27;s collapsed on the floor next to him. &quot;I&#x27;m stupidly, stupidly in love with you. The let&#x27;s-snog-in the-bushes-in front-of-our-elderly neighbors kind of love, really.&quot; &quot;Have we ever snogged in the bushes?&quot; Arthur wonders, tilting his head towards Merlin with a soft smile.

He sounded like a puppy. Merlin’s knees threatened to buckle. “Arthur stop, that’s not gonna work tonight” Melin demanded. The raven-haired teen moved to the couch. “Did you actually get more tickets?” Arthur nodded, “I did” “You didn’t have to do that, spend your money on me I mean” Merlin said. Arthur shook his head this time “I didn’t, I used your card” “ I never should’ve given you my code” Merlin growled. “Are you still mad” the blond asked. “Yes!” merlin said exasperated, he crossed his arms across his chest. It was Arthur’s turn to adopt a moue look. “Sorry” Arthur was beginning to worry, Merlin never stayed mad at him this long. Then he remembered. Arthur grinned mischievously at Merlin. “What, what’s that face for…” Merlin’s eyes widened “no.. don’t you dare!” Arthur launched himself across the couch and onto Merlin. The blonds hands quickly found Merlin’s curved sides and he wiggled his fingers brushing the ticklish skin. Merlin pursed his lips determined to keep his laughter in. When Arthur didn’t get much of a reaction he moved his hands to his best friends underarms then back to his sides quickly. Merlin couldn’t help it if he held in his laughter any longer he was sure he’d combust. He opened his mouth and his melodic laugh filled the room. Arthur also began to laugh his atrociously adorable laugh. As he tried to keep it down his laugh turned to giggles while Merlin laughed hysterically. “Arthur… pl-please, please s-stop” Merlin giggled out. “What?” “I’m… sorry-i’m not … mad I..I promise” Merlin gasped. “Are you sure” “Y-yes” “Okay” Arthur dropped his hands. The two teens were lying one on top of the other, sweaty and messy on the couch. As Arthur’s breath came out in puffs blowing Merlin’s ‘too lazy to cut’ long bangs out of the way they stared into one another&#x27;s eyes. Blue meeting a lighter blue. At that moment Arthur realised how much he had been aching to to taste those luscious tempting lips for forever. The blond leaned down and Merlin’s eyes widened. The space between them decreased at an annoyingly slow pace. After what seemed like forever Merlin moved up and pressed his lips to the blond. He felt Arthur’s lips part as he gasped merlin took advantage and slid his tongue in. After what seemed like forever Merlin moaned and they broke apart. “We should probably get going so we don’t miss the movie” “Yah, okay” they got off the couch and straightened their clothes as best as they could. As they exited Merlin’s house Arthur followed him to the passenger’s seat and opened the door. Merlin got in and before he shut the door Arthur leaned down and gave merlin a quick peck on the lips, Merlin sighed. Arthur never opened the doors for merlin like he had just did but Merlin didn’t care cause it felt good.

Notes &quot;Run Away With Me&quot; - Carly Rae Jepsen See the end of the work for more notes One night, Arthur dies. Or so everyone thought. Within an hour, he’s at Merlin’s window, throwing pebbles on it like some bad boy. “Arthur!” “Quiet! Pack your things and come with me.” So Merlin does what he says and leaves in the night. Away from Camelot. Forever. - “Did you mourn me?” Arthur says when they cross the borders of Camelot and don’t look back. “Seriously. Merlin.” Merlin avoids his gaze and hopes that Arthur can’t see how red his face probably was. He did mourn him. He had truly believed that Arthur had died. And that he had lost him forever. Without ever admitting how he really felt. “If I said that I did, would you explain to me what we are doing out so late.” “We are running away.” And with that, Arthur stopped in his tracks as they stepped into the forest. Then, his hands were on Merlin’s shoulders, pulling him close. It was dark and Merlin felt the urge to let go and conjure some light, but he leans into Arthur’s touch. They were so close that Arthur’s warmth enveloped him on the windy night. “Merlin. I’m sorry. For everything. When I faded away, I thought of you. And now I can’t go back there. Everyone would think I was a ghost. It wouldn’t go back to how it was before. And you’re the only one who I can be with from now on. They’d think I was cursed or magical or something–” “All right. Now, are you done baring your soul to me or are you just going to run away now?” Merlin snarked, putting a hand over one of Arthur’s. He closed the space between them and pressed his forehead against Arthur’s. “How do you trust me so easily, Merlin? How do you even know I’m actually here?” Merlin just intertwines their hands as they continue walking. “Because it’s you. And only the real Arthur would be such a clotpole and throw rocks at my window,” Merlin swung their hands and Arthur scoffed and squeezed his hand. “Also, I can do this. You are definitely real.” “And I am slowly regretting waking up.” - When they venture far beyond the map and away from Camelot, they tear up the map and just wander until they stumble upon a nice, abandoned cottage in the fields. “We’re going to become farmers, Arthur?” “I’ve always wanted to be one if I was not a prince.” “Don’t expect me to do all the heavy lifting!” “But you have magic, Merlin!” “Oh, now, you like magic!” They bicker like nothing changed, as if Arthur had never died and they hadn’t just thrown their lives away for each other. And now they’re starting a new life. Together. Because Merlin would just do that for him. With no hesitation. Maybe he loved him. But he wouldn’t say it. “I think that you’re just being sassy with me because you know that I’m going to end up doing all of the heavy lifting and I’m just still shocked that we did this. Merlin.” Merlin just stared, not knowing what to say. “Well...it’s you, Arthur. I would never just leave you. I couldn’t let you go. When I thought I lost you, I couldn’t even talk to anyone about it,” Merlin finally said softly. Arthur looks back at him, looking as if he’d cry any moment, his heart shattering. “I’m here now, Merlin. And I’ll never leave you again. I didn’t know...I didn’t think I could lose you either. It’s almost happened so many times and I just can’t imagine going on like this if this ends.” “This? What do you mean, Arthur?” And then there’s silence. They’re standing outside the cottage and the sun is setting. It had been nearly a week of walking. Merlin and Arthur had been camping out and talking about anything and everything. Now that there was no one else, they could be honest. The tension was palpable. It’s not like it wasn’t there before. Now it was just them. No one to interrupt them. No one to judge. No one to stop them. No one to get in the way. “I think you’re just saying that, Merlin. We both know that there is something here that we have chosen to never talk about despite how much you love to talk a–” “Shut up, Arthur.” “What?” Then, Merlin was close to him, grabbing his shirt and pulling him in. “Don’t tease me. I can’t take it. If you know how I feel, then why wouldn’t you just do something? String me along, like I’m one of those girls who’d be your flavor of the week. Ugh. I just– Arthur! Please.” Arthur looked back at him, speechless. Merlin had fire in his eyes. Something that rarely ever happened. He was serious. And Arthur couldn’t just ignore his feelings. Rage. Yearning. Frustration. Maybe it was love? He wasn’t sure. And Merlin was still giving him that look. It was so intense. Arthur wasn’t sure if he was feeling intimidated, nervous, or turned on. Maybe it was a combination of all. “What do you want me to do? You have me where you want me. Say it.” They were at a standstill with the sun fading out in the horizon and the darkness slowly overtaking them. Arthur was still staring back at Merlin, still focused on him. Only him. There wasn’t anything that could get between them as Merlin still held on. Merlin looked him up and down, not relenting one bit. And yeah, Arthur was definitely turned on. No way was there any going back from this. Their relationship would never be the same no matter what the outcome of this situation was. Arthur felt vulnerable. He always did around Merlin, but this was different. Like he could have anything happen to him, whether it was rejection, reciprocation, or Merlin straight up murdering him, and he’d still go back to him. He supposed that that was what love was. A commitment despite everything. No, because of everything. “No. I don’t think I won’t,” Merlin was just tempting him at this point, biting his lip and holding his intense gaze. If looks could kill, Arthur would have stayed dead. “Then, what’re you gonna do about it?” “This.” Before Arthur knows it, Merlin’s lips are on his in a passionate kiss. Something that was a long time coming, a moment of release and finality. He deepens it as Merlin runs his hands down his chest and Arthur puts a hand around the back of his neck to pull him closer and closer until they’re kissing and kissing and kissing. Over and over and Arthur starts feeling so warm and his heart is full. Butterflies in his stomach like when he first saw Merlin laugh and he noticed how blue his eyes were. Like he could get lost in his eyes forever, but he was always distracted by whatever Merlin said. Only for him. Just to rile him up and get under his skin, pushing him to his breaking point. The only person who could do that to him. It’s dark by the time they pull away and Arthur can’t breathe. They really did that. And he kissed him back and had melted into his touch, desperate for more. Anything, everything. Just any excuse to keep him close and put him at ease. Merlin is grinning like an idiot. And he’s still got his hands on him. Eager for more. “We don’t need to talk about this. As long as we keep doing that,” Arthur said. “Do you want to do something more?” Arthur may not be a king anymore, but this was worth much more than any crown.

Notes &quot;Diplomat&#x27;s Son&quot; - Vampire Weekend See the end of the work for more notes Merlin doesn’t seem to be enjoying his college years as much as his mother had said he would. Even then, being in one of the most prestigious colleges in the world comes at a cost when all of the dickhead rich bitch kids were attending with you. Also, when your name is Merlin, you tend to invite trouble. His trouble went by the name Arthur Pendragon, a somehow more obnoxious and ridiculous name than Merlin Emrys. Nonetheless, he was his fucking roommate. Oh, and the diplomat’s son. That explained how he was admitted, at least that’s what Merlin thought. Until he realized that the guy was hella smart and also got in for an athletic scholarship as well. Merlin would be lying if he said that he wasn’t going to Oxford’s fencing matches to see what he was made of, but then again, Merlin has always lied. “I’m not gay.” “That was not my fault.” “I don’t like him at all, Gwen!” All of these were lies. So when Arthur and his friends invite him for a party, he reluctantly accepts, knowing that he would soon regret it when the hoards of rich kids arrived and he was nearly passed out in the house of the Oxford Bullingdon Club on a fancy piece of furniture that probably cost more than the tuition he would have paid had he not gotten financial aid. Merlin questions how he ended up there. Then, he recalls the week’s events. It starts in the dorm Merlin shares with Arthur. Since the school year started, Arthur has practically depended on Merlin for everything. They hung out so much that people began to think that they were dating (when they were most definitely not). Merlin would consider Arthur his friend if he wasn’t being such a “prat” on some days. Arthur always thought of him as one (not that he’d ever say it out loud to him). “Headed out to study in the library, wanna come?” Merlin called out to Arthur, who was still in bed. It was 11am and a Saturday. “Why don’t you take a break? You’ve studied every single day since the second semester started. I don’t think I’ve seen you smile all week.” Merlin blushed at the thought that Arthur paid attention to his smiles and he hid his face. He was standing at the doorway of Arthur’s room while Arthur got out and changed in front of him. This was normal because Arthur has no shame and Merlin was the only reason he got out of bed before noon. “We can’t all party like you do, Arthur. Also, I’m not rich enough to fail,” Merlin passed him the jacket Arthur had left on the table. It was his fencing team jacket, a windbreaker in perfect Oxford blue with his last name across the back. Arthur just scoffed at the comment and pulled Merlin along out of the dorm with him. “Fine, but you promised you’d come with me– uh, us, the guys, to the party tonight. And you are not studying on the weekend,” Arthur said as they walked out. Merlin let Arthur maneuver him until they arrived to Arthur’s car. “Where are you taking me after I’ve been kidnapped, Sir Arthur?” Merlin drawled in a silly voice that he called “The Fancyman’s Shitty Accent” as Arthur unlocked the car. “Out.” - This isn’t a date. Right? Merlin’s mind races with thoughts as Arthur takes him out to some nice café with cute little desserts and beautifully crafted coffees that he definitely would not pay for because only rich people pay $12 for coffee. “Relax, Merlin, I’m not going to poison you. I just wanted to take you out,” Arthur says softly. “You’ve been one of my only friends at university who actually cares about me and my grades and not just the team...so I wanted to say, uh, thank you.” Merlin looked up in surprise. Arthur had never said it before. At least, not with such earnest and softness in his voice. He really meant it. “Well, we are stuck with each other, so of course. Someone in school had to knock you down a few pegs, Arthur. And I guess that person was me, God knows why.” Arthur chuckled and Merlin felt a tug at his heartstrings. Something about seeing Arthur happy always made me feel that way. He wasn’t sure why. Guess he’d consult Gwen later at the party or maybe if he saw her around campus. When the check comes, Arthur nearly slams his card down and Merlin blushes as he says, “This date’s on me, Merlin.” So it was a date? Or was Arthur just being Arthur? Merlin just sipped his overpriced coffee and laughed as Arthur did a double take when calculating the tip. He’s still a dollophead. But he could be his. Maybe. - Arthur heads to an impromptu practice and brings Merlin along. “You are not studying. I swear to God.” Merlin just let him drag him along, enjoying the warmth of Arthur’s arm on his. The rest of the fencing team greets Merlin like he’s one of the girlfriends of one of the players: with some wolf-whistles and jabs about his hair and attitude. “Thanks Gwaine, my hair’s a mess because I just left your mum’s bed.” Arthur laughed the hardest whenever Merlin shot back at their jeers. Gwen was there with Lancelot. Because that is an on-and-off thing that he would hear about during their study sessions. Apparently it’s currently on, considering how Gwen was there before Merlin and waiting on him. “Oh, look who decided to show up. The other girlfriends left,” Gwen patted the spot on the bench next to her. She had her notebooks with her and a few books. “Haha, very funny,” Merlin deadpanned as he sat down and looked off at Arthur. He waves at Merlin and gives him a cheeky smile before he puts his mask down and starts up his practice with Elyan as Percival, Gwaine, Lancelot, and Leon watch. “I hope your brother is prepared to get his arse kicked,” Merlin mutters as Arthur swings at him and Elyan clashes, then takes a step back. “No, he isn’t. So...I heard you were out and about with the diplomat’s son, prince of Oxford,” Gwen teased, closing her book and snapping her fingers in front of Merlin. He had been dreamily staring at Arthur. She always caught it. During class. During games. Even in the bloody dorm. He’s hopeless. “And what about it?” Merlin faced her and rolled his eyes. Another day, another lecture from Gwen. “I heard he breaks hearts, Merlin. I don’t want to be the one bringing ice cream over in the middle of the night because Pendragon let you down. You deserve more than that.” She gave him a sad smile, like he was a little puppy she had found drowning in a river. Merlin knew that those smiles always meant that she really cared. She was worried. Like his mother had been when he was stood up by a boy and then he locked himself in his room and blasted music until he stopped crying. Like Gaius was concerned when he would pull all-nighters to complete his work and he would arrive at family functions, messily dressed and half asleep. The same look he had gotten from all of the people who cared about him when they realized that they needed to stop him before he’s in too deep. Ready to drown for whatever. “Break hearts? Arthur’s only breaking his own bones. Come on. It was only one date. Whatever you’d call it. He said it was. I didn’t expect anything!” Merlin put his hands up in surrender and Gwen raised an eyebrow in disbelief. After about two hours, Arthur and the guys leave and they all head back to their dorms to prepare for the party. Arthur immediately falls asleep on the couch after he showers and then he and Merlin watch TV. Merlin was reading a book about some wizard helping a knight and then falling in love with him. It was really interesting, but he kept getting distracted because Arthur had laid his head on his shoulder and dozed off. Merlin chuckled as he put a blanket over him and continued reading until he began to fall asleep as well. He sets his book down and puts his glasses away. The obnoxiously loud knocking on the door wakes them up. “Arthur! Get your girlfriend and let’s go!” Gwaine was extra hyperactive today. The other guys were knocking too. Merlin felt Arthur shift and poke his face as he took his arm off of him, withdrawing the warmth Merlin was enjoying. Arthur whispers, “Merlin. It’s time to go,” in the softest tone Merlin had ever heard and he tilted his head to face him. They were so close that they could feel each other’s breaths. A moment passes as they stare, then another knock ruins it. “Guys!” Arthur sighed and pulled Merlin up as he stood. They rush out the door and Arthur punches Gwaine in the arm for interrupting. Merlin feels like doing it too, but he knows it wouldn’t be as good. “Always a pleasure to hear a fucking riot outside our dorm,” Merlin mutters, garnering laughs and a playful nudge as Arthur loops his arm around his shoulders. - They pick up Gwen from her dorm (but in a nicer fashion, sending Merlin up because the other girls didn’t find him threatening and they all realized that he’s gay) and they head out to the Oxford Bullingdon Club house. Merlin starts to shiver as they walk. He had left his jacket in the dorm since they were forced to leave so fast. As he started rubbing his arms, he felt a wave of warmth overtake him as something was draped over his shoulders. He looked down to see Oxford blue fabric around him. Then he felt Arthur’s hands on his as he whispered, “Can’t have you catching a bloody cold so close to exams, Merlin. Here. Just stay warm. Please.” And with that and Arthur’s hand intertwining with his right, Merlin realized that Arthur did care about him. So much that he would let him wear his jacket. With his name on it. Like he was one of the fencing team’s girlfriends. Shit. He was now. Even Lancelot didn’t lend his jacket to Gwen. But then again, Merlin and Arthur were much more stable than they were. Also, Gwen rarely got cold and Lancelot wasn’t exactly the romantic type. “Just don’t be a cabbage head and complain that it’s cold for the rest of the night,” Arthur snarked as he swung their hands. Gwen gave Merlin a knowing look and he held up a middle finger. The other guys didn’t get why Gwen was laughing so hard out of nowhere. - The party was your typical college get-together. A bunch of students getting too drunk too fast and some property damage that no one wanted to take responsibility for– just what Merlin had missed out on during high school. At least he had friends this time. Arthur gets him a drink without him asking and he stays with him the whole time– except for when he was playing a drinking game or participating in whatever shenanigans that were being unleashed by the other sports teams. Morgana finds him while Arthur is playing a silly game with the boys and she sits next to him as he watches closeby. She’s the most beautiful woman there, looking as if she didn’t belong in the chaotic environment. Her dress was sparkling and her hair and makeup were still perfect despite how late it was getting. Somehow, she had a glass of wine in her hand. Morgana looked as if she fit in better with the art students rather than some boy’s club rager. In fact, Merlin thought that she was too regal for these things. What was she doing here rather than at some wine and cheese tasting that the other pre-law students would be at? “Needed to make sure my brother gets home without a mess,” is what she proclaims, speaking as if she was stating Arthur’s verdict in a courtroom. “Don’t worry, Morgana. I’m here,” Merlin said, not taking his eyes off of Arthur. It was kind of a funny sight to see: someone as gorgeous as Morgana just sat right next to Merlin and him not even paying any mind to her because he’s enamoured by her brother who was flipping cups and yelling like a fucking barbarian. To each their own, she guessed as she sipped. “Oh, I know he has never given anyone his jacket before,” Morgana said in her version of a shocked tone. “Not ever. Not even in high school when girls were throwing themselves at him. Funny how you’re the first and probably the only ever…” Merlin tears his eyes away from Arthur and faces her, his face heating up. “What do you mean? I’m sure he’s given someone else it before. I was cold, so he just put it around me. Probably doesn’t mean anything!” Morgana laughed and waved her glass around, the red wine swirling like Merlin’s insides were as he felt butterflies in his stomach at the thought of Arthur liking him back, him being the only one ever. “Oh, when my brother shows affection, it means something. He barely says he loves his family to their faces and he gives me a hug on the holidays when our father is there to prove that we haven’t been having a sibling argument!” Morgana smirked as she got up and patted Merlin’s shoulder, then poked the Oxford emblem on the front, which had “Pendragon” embroidered underneath in small print. “Just saying. You’re special. Good night, Merlin.” He was left dumbfounded by a Pendragon for the second time that day. - The next morning, Arthur’s hangover is a hell. Somehow for Merlin as well, even though he had barely drunk any alcohol. Because Arthur needed him and he wouldn’t talk to anyone else. “Here is your hangover special. Because you need to be sharp for tomorrow. And I am not going to be sharing notes with you because you called my handwriting ‘hieroglyphics’ the last time you saw them,” Merlin said, passing Arthur a drink he always made whenever he’s had too much the night before. Arthur took the glass and drank it all in one go. Merlin sighed. Why’d he have to like this idiot? And why’d it have to make him an idiot too? “Thanks, Merlin. You are a lifesaver.” Before he heads out, Merlin draws the curtains shut so Arthur can sleep more and puts another blanket over the bed. Then, he faces Arthur, who is still sitting up. “I’ll be back soon. Studying with Gwen. Call me if you need anything,” he says like he usually does whenever he leaves Arthur. “All right. Love you. Bye,” Arthur says too casually, then he pulls Merlin in for a quick kiss and he lies back down. Merlin mutters, “Love you too.” Then, he leaves his room, shutting the door gently and exiting the dorm with his bag and phone in his hand. It was only when he arrived at the pathway outside leading to the library that he realized what Arthur had said and what he had said back. And what he had done. “Wait, what the fuck?!” Merlin touches his lips to feel that he was still alive and not dreaming or hallucinating. Nope. Still real. Gwen could only laugh when she gets a rushed rant about it. - A week later, when Merlin arrives back at the dorm and realizes that he had been wearing Arthur’s jacket around campus for an entire seven days and Arthur hadn’t said anything about him returning it. He doesn’t mention it. A few days later, Arthur and him take a break from hanging out with the others and just enjoy each other’s company. They head out to an open area on campus and just smoke. Looking up at the stars. Merlin usually doesn’t like smoking, but it calmed his nerves sometimes. Also, Arthur always had the good stuff since he was rich. Arthur didn’t smoke often. Just when he could tell that he and Merlin needed a break from all of the stress that came with their studying, Arthur’s fencing, and Merlin’s competitions. At least they weren’t doing hard drugs in an alley. Instead, they were smoking the finest kush, sitting on a nice picnic blanket on the finest grass field at night. Just staring up at the moon. Without a care in the world. “Ha, you’re still wearing my jacket,” Arthur says as he pulls at Merlin’s sleeve gently. Merlin is glad that it’s dark because he can’t see him blushing. “Yeah. You never asked for it back. And I like it. A lot.” “You can keep wearing it. It’s making the other guys jealous. Their girlfriends don’t wear their jackets. Because they never wash them!” Arthur and Merlin burst into fits of giggles. They’re barely high, but they’re starting to feel it. After a while, Arthur says, “Are you hungry? Cause I am.” Merlin replies, “I got extra pizza in the dorm that I saved from lunch today.” When they start getting up and wrapping up the blanket, Arthur says, “Ugh. Thank God. I love you.” “Do you really mean that? Or are you just saying that?” Merlin looks up at him with pleading eyes. Arthur looks down and softens. “Of course I mean it. When we didn’t talk about what happened, I just assumed that I had dreamed it. Or you just don’t feel the same, Merlin.” Merlin doesn’t know what to say so he kisses Arthur. In the middle of the field. Underneath the stars. After they had just taken a few hits and called it quits. Because they were both hungry and yearning and Merlin could feel his heart beating faster because this is real. Arthur meant it. “I love you too.” When Merlin wakes up in Arthur’s bed, he’s gone. Arthur had an early class and had left a note on the bedside table: Early class. Second date after? Yours, Arthur. x Merlin went back to sleep and glanced at Arthur’s jacket, which was hanging off Arthur’s chair, untouched after he draped it there before joining Arthur in bed last night. Guess he’s dating the diplomat’s son.
