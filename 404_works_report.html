                <div class="summary">Dark!fic The Kingdom of Avalon has fallen. Arthur finds himself the reluctant keeper of the fallen enemy prince. Destiny had somehow made a mistake. *** &quot;You don&#x27;t have to, you know,&quot; Arthur said. &quot;Not all the time.&quot; &quot;What?&quot; came Merlin’s clipped response from the corner after a moment. Arthur turned around to face his captive. &quot;Be this,&quot; he gestured at Merlin broadly. &quot;Be defiant, brave....stoic....all the time. It is painful to watch.&quot; Merlin didn&#x27;t answer. Arthur sighed. &quot;Just....just....when that door closes, when we reach the end of the day. Just allow yourself to relax for just a while.&quot; Arthur tried on a small smile, holding his palms up in a gesture of surrender. &quot;I promise I won&#x27;t tell anybody.&quot;</div>

                <div class="summary">Merlin is in love with Prince Arthur. The only problem is that Arthur is in love with Guinevere. Arthur is head over heels in love with Merlin but is convinced the warlock is in love with Morgana, so Arthur is dating Guinevere to make them jealous. Merlin and Morgana aren’t in love, they just tend to pretend to make out to hide that they’re practicing magic together in secret Basically a fake dating au where both Merlin and Arthur are idiots (hence the &quot;the love is requited, they&#x27;re just idiots&quot; tag) Notes See the end of the work for notes There was a knock at the door of Arthur’s chambers. “Enter,” Arthur said, not looking up from his reading. Merlin glanced up at the door from where he was grabbing Arthur’s riding clothes. Gwen entered the room, head held high. “Your Highness,” Gwen said. “The Lady Morgana would like to coordinate outfits with you for the upcoming feast tomorrow.” Merlin looked up at Gwen, the blood draining from his face. He would undoubtedly have to help with all the last minute preparations of said feast. Gwen gave him a sympathetic smile. At least they would be working together. “What possessed Morgana to do that?” Arthur asked, putting down his scroll. “What color was she thinking?” “Emerald green, Your Highness,” Gwen said, curtseying. Arthur’s lip curled in disgust. “Of course she chose green,” he muttered. “Alright. Tell Morgana that that is acceptable. Have Merlin help you with the arrangements.” Merlin looked at Gwen, biting back a groan. “Yes, Your Highness,” Gwen replied with a curtsey before leaving the room. Merlin put down Arthur’s riding clothes and followed after her. If Arthur complained, he only had himself to blame. “So what does this all entail?” Merlin asked. “We find Arthur an outfit in emerald that matches Lady Morgana’s dress.” “That would be easier if Arthur wore anything that wasn’t red,” Merlin grumbled. Gwen laughed as they strode down the halls. “Luckily the tailors already know Arthur’s measurements, it won’t be hard to have something made quickly.” “Is anything quick and easy when it comes to Arthur?” Merlin asked, raising an eyebrow. Gwen laughed again, inclining her head towards Merlin. “Good point. He does have some charming features to him, though.” Merlin’s stomach twisted. A sudden annoyance toward Gwen arose in his chest but he quashed it down. He didn’t want to feel ill will towards her, but it still sat there like a curled dragon, waiting to catch him off guard again. Likely that night when sleep eluded him. “Right,” Merlin muttered under his breath, quiet enough that he thought Gwen wouldn’t hear. Gwen tilted her head and studied him before deciding to pretend she hadn’t heard. Gwen and Merlin passed hurried servants with arms full of decorations and cleaning supplies. “We might also have to help prepare for the feast itself. I will, at least, since Morgana already has a dress.” “I can help. It’ll get me away from Arthur for a while and I’ll be of use for something other than target practice.” Gwen gave a small snort of laughter. “Sorry,” she mumbled. “It’s alright, everyone knows how much of a royal prat Arthur is. I would expect nothing less.” Gwen smiled and shook her head before knocking at the tailor’s door. Entering the room, she said, “Prince Arthur needs a formal outfit for the feast tomorrow.” The tailor nodded wearily. “The usual red?” “No, he’ll be coordinating with Lady Morgana. Emerald green.” “I’ll see what I can do,” the tailor said. “Sorry,” Merlin said. The tailor gave Merlin a weak smile, the bags under his eyes weighing down his entire frame with exhaustion. “Is there something wrong?” Gwen asked, resting a hand on the tailor’s arm. “You seem more exhausted and harried than usual.” “The Lady Morgana convinced King Uther to reinstate the servants’ ball, so I’m working overtime to make items for the servants as well.” “I’m sorry,” Gwen said. “What’s the servants’ ball?” Merlin asked. “It’s a celebration for the servants after the regular feasting activities. A ‘thank you’ of sorts for all the hard work the servants do,” Gwen explained. Merlin nodded. “Is it required?” “Not necessarily, but there will be better food than you get otherwise and I’m requiring you to come with me. We’ll coordinate outfits. I’m thinking a nice blue.” Merlin smiled. “Well then I guess you’re in luck because blue’s my favorite color.” “I’m glad, because I embroidered you a cloak, so there’s no backing out now.” Merlin blanched. “A cloak?” Gwen nodded. “It has stars on it, just wait until you see it.” “This feast was announced today, when did you have the time to make me a cloak?” Gwen shrugged. “A girl gets bored, you know. Besides, I thought it would make a nice Yule gift.” “How did you know my measurements?” Gwen smiled, a mischievous twinkle in her eye. “A girl’s got to have her secrets, Merlin.” Merlin backed away slowly with wide eyes. Gwen laughed. “While you were out helping Arthur, I talked to Gaius. He let me into your room to get the measurements.” Merlin nodded despite his unease. What if she had seen his magic book? “Well, let’s leave the tailor to his work, there’s more to be done,” Gwen said. Merlin wordlessly followed her out and back into the bustling halls. “Do you have a dress for the servants’ ball?” Merlin asked. “I do. Lady Morgana gave it to me as a gift. It’s what inspired me to make your cloak.” “I’m flattered you made me a cloak,” Merlin said. “Of course,” Gwen said, hip checking Merlin. “We’re friends, that’s what friends do.” Merlin laughed. “Guess I better learn to sew, then,” he joked. “That’s unnecessary, but you could help me pick wildflowers to put around the castle,” Gwen said. Merlin nodded. “Sure.” “But for now, we have feast preparations and masters to tend to.” They strode down the halls quickly, Gwen rushing to a servant overburdened with boxes, grabbing the other side of the box. “Well, let’s get to work then,” Merlin said to himself, pushing up his sleeves. He lost Gwen in the commotion but he’d find her eventually. The feast, which was in full swing by then, was a boisterous affair. The bubbling anticipation of the servants’ ball was the only thing keeping all the servants awake as the party went on through the night. Morgana was certainly right, in emerald green, she and Arthur were a stunning picture of elegance and rivaled every other person at the party, even the dignitaries from the neighboring kingdom who had decided to descend upon Camelot so suddenly. But Arthur didn’t have eyes for Morgana. He kept looking over at where Merlin and Guinevere stood together, stunning visions in midnight blue, the lights of the candles catching on the gold and silver embroidered stars on their outfits. Merlin studied Arthur out of the corner of his eyes. Arthur’s gaze kept flitting to him and Gwen. He’s probably swooning over Gwen, Merlin thought bitterly as he filled goblets with wine. As the feasting ended, the band struck up a tune and the dancing began. Merlin watched the glittering nobles and their celebration, not able to do anything more than hold a wine pitcher and maybe shuffle his feet. Gwen bumped shoulders with him. “Cheer up, we’ll be dancing ourselves in a few hours.” “The food better be worth it,” Merlin grumbled. “It will be.” Eventually, the feast wound down and the nobles departed. Merlin helped Arthur undress and retire for the night, not bothering to take off his cloak. It was comfortable and smelled faintly of wildflowers. “Good night, Merlin,” Arthur said as Merlin snuffed out the candles. “Good night,” Merlin said, already on his way out the door. “That cloak suits you.” Merlin stopped, hand resting on the door handle. What was he supposed to say? “Thank you,” Merlin said before closing the door and walking away. He followed the groups of servants crackling with nervous excitement. They obviously knew the way. The less he had to think about where he was walking, the more he could ruminate on what Arthur had said. “Merlin,” Gwen said. He stopped walking, looking around. She popped up at his elbow, linking arms with him. “We have to make our grand entrance together.” Merlin nodded and let Gwen lead him through the castle. The servants’ ball wasn’t like the balls and feasts he was used to. It had the same food, cast offs and leftovers from the feast earlier in the evening, and everyone was dressed in their best, but there weren’t silver plates and a professional band, it was wooden trenchers and the cook had brought her harp. “We’re the best dressed here,” Merlin joked. “Of course we are, isn’t that the point?” Gwen and Merlin exchanged a grin. Gwen opened her hand to Merlin. “Shall we?” Merlin took her hand and let her lead him to the dance floor. They danced, Merlin letting Gwen lead, since she knew more about dancing than he did. They swirled through the dance floor much like Arthur and Morgana had earlier but a starry vision. End Notes This first chapter is short, but they&#x27;ll get longer as they go on This was the inspiration for Merlin’s cloak and Gwen’s dress bc why not You can find us at pirates-and-candles and thehotasfuckgay on tumblr.</div>

                <div class="summary">Quite simply, the lyrics of &#x27;The Confrontation&#x27; from Les Misérables rewritten for a scenario in which Arthur finds out about Merlin&#x27;s magic. Notes I&#x27;ve really enjoyed seeing Les Mis at the cinema, and this is my favourite song. Then I told my friend Blackthorn14 (Find her on DA, Tumblr etc!) that someone should rewrite the words for Arthur finding out about Merlin&#x27;s magic. Then I had a go and so did she, and some of her lines were much better than mine, and some of mine she preferred over hers; so I did a bit of cutting and copying and some tweaking here and there, and what you see before you is a more or less equal collaboration. Unfortunately neither of us can sing, but we were pretty pleased with how it turned out, so it seemed a shame not to post it up somewhere... Someone clever Merlin cosplayers need to record this for us. Please, talented people of the internet, do it! For best effect, try singing this along to the track :) We used the film version, though :) [ARTHUR] Merlin, at last, Your secret becomes plain A sorcerer And Camelot’s betrayed [MERLIN] Before you say another word, Arthur Before you send me to the stake to burn Listen to me! There is something you should know. I was working for our destiny. Everything I did I did for you, For Camelot, I fought as best I knew We’re two sides of the same coin. Different sides- [ARTHUR] Merlin, stop it now! I&#x27;ve seen the things magic can do You deserve no trust from me A liar like you. [MERLIN(counterpoint)] Believe of me what you will This is something I had to do You don’t know what I’ve done All I did was save your life You know nothing I have done If not for me you would be dead My magic helped build Albion I am warning you Arthur You still need me by your side There is power in this world That you can’t face alone [ARTHUR(counterpoint)] You have tricked me all these years I considered you a friend No, It was all a lie How many men have I lost? How many fights? Come with me you sorcerer I’ll go on with my father’s deeds Our friendship means nothing now No mercy for scum like you You belong inside a jail All these years you’ve lived a lie You have treated me as a fool How could you keep this from me? I would have kept your secret well If you’d proved that you trust me I’d believe this destiny!</div>

                <div class="summary">Arthur and Merlin wake Gaius. They&#x27;re absolutely terrible liars. The homophobia is mostly implied, nothing outright. &quot;Merlin?&quot; Arthur hissed out, as he leaned into a crevice in the wall. &quot;Arthur! Finally.&quot; The dark haired boy popped out from his hiding place, bringing a relieved sigh from Arthur. &quot;I was held up. My father.&quot; Merlin nodded in understanding and the two slipped into the dark. Minutes later Merlin was pressed back against the stone wall, hips held down by Arthur&#x27;s hand. The blonde boy nipped gently at Merlin&#x27;s neck, murmuring into his ear. &quot;Missed you.&quot; Merlin sighed into the touch of Arthur&#x27;s lips, and the blonde brought his head up, bringing his lips to Merlin&#x27;s. The two pressed together, Merlin tugging his lover close. Several minutes later, the two broke apart, chests heaving and lips swollen. Merlin grinned up at Arthur, who returned the look. Arthur took Merlin by the hand and the two slipped quietly up to Merlin&#x27;s room. As soon as the door shut Arthur was pulling Merlin close again, seeking any touch. The blonde pushed Merlin back slightly, falling onto the bed. Merlin laughed, then clapped a hand over his mouth, his eyes twinkling. Arthur snorted, but the two quickly became involved in each other&#x27;s touch once again. Arthur lay on top of Merlin, cradling the dark haired boy&#x27;s face in his hand, and kissing the life out of him. Merlin wrapped his arms around Arthur, pulling him closer. Arthur slid one hand away from Merlin&#x27;s face, and slowly slid it under the fabric of Merlin&#x27;s shirt, his hand resting on Merlin&#x27;s stomach, a gentle warmth. Arthur&#x27;s lips traveled down Merlin&#x27;s neck, the smaller boy moaning quietly and the sensation. Arthur rested his other hand on Merlin&#x27;s chest, and then whispered out a rough, &quot;Off.&quot; Merlin sat up, tugging the shirt over his shoulders, before laying back down, a blush spreading down his neck to his chest. Arthur smirked at him, then re-connected their lips briefly, his mouth traveling slowly across Merlin&#x27;s torso, teasing his nipples gently, slowly, before traveling down further. He teased Merlin a bit, tracing patterns across Merlin&#x27;s stomach, knowing he was ticklish. &quot;Arthur!&quot; Merlin hissed, his stomach tensing in protest. Merlin shoved at Arthur&#x27;s head lightly, teasingly, but Arthur got off Merlin entirely. &quot;Oh, you want me off then?&quot; He smirked, and Merlin groaned. &quot;No, I don&#x27;t.&quot; &quot;You sure? You really seemed like you didn&#x27;t there.&quot; His tone was teasing, and Merlin replied with, &quot;I don&#x27;t want you tickling me, but I want you...there...&quot; &quot;Where?&quot; &quot;/There/. Arthur, you know what I mean!&quot; &quot;I wanna hear you say it.&quot; Arthur said, murmuring into his ear, as he lowered his body back down onto Merlin&#x27;s. Merlin rolled his eyes, but muttered out, &quot;I want you on my cock.&quot; Arthur laughed, low in his throat. &quot;Perfect.&quot; The blonde slid back down to Merlin&#x27;s stomach, and after pressing a kiss to his belly button and getting a threatening glare from Merlin he went lower. Arthur grabbed at Merlin&#x27;s trousers, sliding them off his legs. His head went down, and Merlin&#x27;s back arched. ------- Sometime later Arthur lay on Merlins chest, both boys sweaty, their bare skin rosy from their activities. They lay in silence, snuggled into each other, their legs entwined, candlelight flickering on them. Merlin slid his hand onto Arthur&#x27;s cheek, tilting the blonde&#x27;s head so their eyes met. &quot;Hmm?&quot; Arthur mumbled sleepily. &quot;I love you.&quot; Arthur smiled, his eyes close to shutting. &quot;Love you too Mer.&quot; Suddenly, the door opened, showing the shocked face of Gaius. &quot;Excuse me?!&quot; The two jumped, Merlin trying to stutter out an excuse. &quot;Um, uh, I was jus- I mean, we were just-&quot; Arthur interuppted. &quot;We were just hot.&quot; Merlin glared at him when Gaius glanced away, to which Arthur raised his eyebrows, with an expression saying, &#x27;what else could I say.&#x27; &quot;You were hot then.&quot; Gaius said, clearly unbelieving, &quot;Why were you here in the first place then your Majesty? In Merlin&#x27;s bed of all places.&quot; &quot;Well, um,&quot; Now it was Arthur&#x27;s turn to sputter. &quot;He had a disagreement with his father, and needed some place to cool off. We got tired.&quot; Merlin offered. Gaius raised an eyebrow, and then sighed. &quot;I&#x27;m sure you could return to your room without confrontation from your father now my lord.&quot; &quot;Certainly.&quot; Arthur glanced at the door, knowing he was still undressed. &quot;I&#x27;ll leave in a moment.&quot; Arthur nodded at Gaius, who sighed and left the room, but not before giving Merlin a Look. As soon as the door shut, Arthur scrambled for his clothes, as did Merlin. &quot;Hey,&quot; Arthur said, catching sight of Merlin&#x27;s fearful face. &quot;We&#x27;ll be okay. I can see to that.&quot; Merlin nodded, and Arthur brushed his cheek softly with his hand, then leaned in for a quick, very quick kiss. The two went downstairs, and after bidding Gaius goodnight, Arthur was on his way. Merlin avoided the old man&#x27;s eyes, and tried to walk quietly to his room, but Gaius stopped him. &quot;So. Are you going to explain?&quot; &quot;I thought we already had.&quot; Gaius sighed, and sat down. &quot;Merlin. I&#x27;m not stupid. Besides the fact that both of your clothes were strewn about the floor and your bodies are both strewn with kissbruises, you are both terrible, terrible, liars.&quot; Merlin let out a gust of air, and sat down, his face in his hand. After a moment he raised his head, meeting Gaius&#x27;s eyes. &quot;I&#x27;m sorry.&quot; &quot;Do you love him?&quot; &quot;What?&quot; &quot;I asked you if you love him. Do you?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; Merlin whispered, eyes on the floor now. &quot;And he you?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;How long?&quot; &quot;Less than a year. Eight months, in two weeks.&quot; &quot;Well. Invite him here tommorow, I just talk with him.&quot; Merlin looked up, wary. &quot;Why?&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m your guardian, I have to approve of him. He may be the kings son, but that doesn&#x27;t mean he gets to hurt my ward.&quot; Gaius looked down at Merlin kindly, whose face clearly showed his shock. &quot;You aren&#x27;t going to kick me out? Or report us?&quot; &quot;No, I&#x27;m not Merlin. I care for you, if Arthur is who makes you happy then so be it. Doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m going to go easy on him tommorow though.&quot; He said with a wink. &quot;Thank you.&quot; Merlin said, still somewhat dazed. &quot;Of course.&quot;</div>
