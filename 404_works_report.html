Not one bit! Notes Prompt 304: Saviour by ObsidianSerpent A/N : I intended to write something quite angsty but decided to go in the opposite direction with this one. Disclaimer : Merlin characters are the property of Shine and BBC. No profit is being made, and no copyright infringement is intended. Arthur was making his way outdoors to go to the training grounds when Sir Leon ran up to him, out of breath. “Sire, there is commotion at the stables.” When they arrived, it was to see Percival and Gwaine kneeling beside someone lying on the ground. Percival looked up at Arthur, his expression worried. “I don’t think he’s hurt too badly. The cat was on the roof,” were his only words. He looked as if he wanted to say more, but Arthur put up a hand and shook his head. He’d talk to Percival more in- depth later, but he’d heard all he needed for now. He had more important things to worry about. He didn’t need to look down to see who it was on the ground. Percival wouldn’t have given him that look unless it was Merlin. Arthur pushed the others out of his way and carefully picked up Merlin, only worrying afterwards that perhaps he should have left him on the ground until he could be checked out for injuries, but as Merlin was trying to talk, Arthur took that as a positive sign. He visibly relaxed once he saw that the damage didn’t seem too bad, and he briefly wondered whether he wanted to throttle Merlin or kiss him more. He opened his mouth to ask what had happened when he heard a familiar meow. Arthur sighed. He should have known. Damned cat! If Arthur had told Merlin once he’d told him a hundred times to not play with that cat! Hadn’t Arthur told him to be careful, that the cat didn’t like to be cuddled? It was a cat after all, even if it was small and perhaps a smidgeon cute and adorable. Arthur would have to have words with Percival, but first he had to take care of Merlin. Careful not to jostle Merlin, Arthur continued to glare at the cat. He had half a mind to put his sword through it, but he knew that if he did, Merlin would never forgive him, and Percival wouldn’t be happy either. “You are a menace to society, cat,” he said instead, glaring at it, but the look the feline gave him had Arthur thinking that he was the one being reprimanded, not the cat. The thought made Arthur chuckle. “I don’t know who is more the idiot here, you or Merlin.” Arthur made a shooing motion with his hand, but the cat refused to move. Arthur was about to kick it when Merlin opened an eye and cleared his throat. Arthur had been caught. Damn Merlin and his sixth sense! “You leave that cat alone, Arthur. He didn’t do anything to you.” Arthur let out another laugh. Merlin was amazing… an amazing idiot. The amazing idiot that Arthur just so happened to love. “No, but he nearly killed you. Am I not allowed to be upset about that?” Merlin tried to laugh, but grimaced, probably in pain. “If you want to be angry with someone, be angry with me. I was the one who decided to go up there to get the cat. That cat didn’t coax me onto the roof. I am a big boy, Arthur, and I can make my own decisions, believe it or not,” he finished, with more than a little condescension in his voice. All the fight went out of Arthur. As angry as he was with Merlin, and he was plenty angry, he was more thankful. Merlin could have easily been killed in the fall. Silly boy. Hadn’t he been told to stay in bed until he was over the sweating sickness? Gaius had lectured him about how important it was to get his strength back, and he had forbade Merlin to go back to work for a fortnight. The recovery period had seemed excessive to Arthur, but who was he to tell the Court Physician what was right and what was wrong when it came to medical conditions? Yes, he was King of Camelot, but if that qualified him to make diagnoses of the medical persuasion, he hadn’t been informed, thus, until that day arrived he would leave that business to more educated people than himself. “You idiot,” he spat out. “Did you honestly think it a good idea to climb atop the stables and play the hero? What were you doing out of bed anyway? I thought you were on strict bedrest.” Merlin opened his mouth to answer Arthur, but Gaius’s concerned voice rent the air as he called after Arthur and Merlin. “He’ll live, Gaius,” said Arthur, swallowing the words he wanted to say next. “A few bumps and scratches, but I don’t think he was hurt too badly.” Once Merlin was safely back in his bed, Arthur began the inquisition. One question after another, not stopping to take a breath. “Arthur,” Merlin interrupted, rolling his eyes, “Percival’s cat came into my room. I have no idea how he got here, but he did. I decided to take him back. I knew neither you nor Gaius would be happy with me, but I thought I could get there and back before you’d notice I was gone. How was I to know the cat would get away from me and jump up on the roof of the stables?” “So, being the hero you are,” said Arthur, shaking his head in exasperation, “you just had to follow him, didn’t you?” “Yep,” said Merlin, matter-of-factly, obviously quite proud of himself. He put on this cocky attitude far too often for Arthur&#x27;s liking, but it was one of the qualities Arthur loved so much. “What am I going to do with you, Merlin?” Merlin smirked. “If you want to keep a closer eye on me, Arthur, you could always ask me to stay with you so you can play mother hen.” Such insolence could not be tolerated so Arthur did the only thing he could. He leant over to kiss Merlin. Yes, he would be moving Merlin into his chambers immediately.</span> <a href="#" class="summary-toggle">[ + ]</a></div>

                <div class="summary"><span class="summary-short">“Absolutely not,” Merlin said, looking at his husband as if he had two heads, “You’re eight months pregnant Arthur!

I’m not going to let you fly to another country regardless of whether I’m with you or not!” Notes For Saja and part of the BBC Merlin Father&#x27;s Mpreg Fest “Absolutely not,” Merlin said, looking at his husband as if he had two heads, “You’re eight months pregnant Arthur! I’m not going to let you fly to another country regardless of whether I’m with you or not!” Arthur huffed and leaned back on the couch, rubbing his large stomach. “It’s your fault I’m like this anyway,” he replied, “And it’s not like we could take a trip after the baby is born, at least not for awhile, and even then we won’t be able to do everything we would have otherwise.” Merlin sighed and sat down next to Arthur, wrapping his arms around him. Arthur shifted on the couch, leaning against Merlin’s chest and closing his eyes. Merlin held him close, pressing a soft kiss into Arthur’s golden hair. The pregnancy had not been an easy one. Merlin&#x27;s magic helped as much as it could in keeping the baby and Arthur healthy, but it worsened the side effects. Merlin always worried for him, though Arthur told him not to. Arthur was strong, yes, but Merlin loved him too much to let anything happen. The rest of the evening passed uneventfully, watching Toy Story again because Arthur wanted to, cuddling on the couch. Merlin helped Arthur up despite his protests that it really wasn&#x27;t necessary and helped him into bed. &quot;You know I love you more than anything,&quot; Merlin whispered into Arthur&#x27;s back, &quot;I won&#x27;t let anything happen to you.&quot; &quot;I love you too,&quot; Arthur replied, &quot;Get some sleep, idiot.&quot; Merlin laughed, &quot;Prat.&quot; Even after Arthur&#x27;s breathing evened out, Merlin lay awake. He knew that Arthur had started feeling trapped by the limitations of pregnancy, but it wasn&#x27;t safe to take him anywhere this far along. When Arthur had first gotten pregnant, he had been unsure about wanting to carry, but after a series of conversations with Merlin, Morgana, Gwen, and Dr. Gaius, he decided he could do it. For the most part he loved it, especially the extent to which he could get Merlin to do things for him. But Merlin could see that there was still that little bit of reluctance, the fear that something will go wrong, the fear it would change everything too much for them to handle. Merlin pulled Arthur closer to him and swore that he would do everything he could to take away the fear. ***** Where was he? Arthur sighed and began pacing, well, waddling around their living room. The past few days Merlin had seemed distracted and distant, and now he was late to their date night that he had suggested. Was there someone else? would he have to do this by himself? Arthur steadied himself against the end of the cough. No, that was ridiculous. This was Merlin, they love each other and it will stay that way. Before he could continue speculating the door flew open and there was Merlin. &quot;What are you wearing?&quot; Arthur exclaimed, staring at his husband, who appeared to be in a pilot&#x27;s uniform, but with a bouree on his head and a lei around his neck. &quot;Mr. Pendragon, welcome!&quot; Merlin said, beaming, &quot;Please come aboard, it&#x27;s time to depart!&quot; Merlin helped him out of their house, where they were greeted by a convertible that definitely did not belong to them. &quot;I rented it,&quot; Merlin explained as he opened the door for Arthur, &quot;And off we go!&quot; As they drove, Arthur studied Merlin, who kept glancing at Arthur, trying to gage his reaction. Finally, they came to a stop in front of the local football stadium where Arthur&#x27;s pick up team plays. Merlin jumped out of the car and rushed to help Arthur. The stadium seemed empty when they entered, but Merlin led him to a seat anyway. Arthur was about to ask what Merlin was doing when a voice brought his attention to the pitch. &quot;Welcome amigo to the amazing perro fight of Madrid!&quot; Gwaine cheered from down below, wearing tights and a ridiculous sparkling jacket, and holding a bright red cloth. &quot;Ehrm... He means toro, like a bull,&quot; Merlin explained, then yelled down at Gwaine, &quot;Stop trying to speak Spanish!&quot; Then the music started to swell, and another figure ran out onto the pitch. It was Percy, wearing all brown and a pair of horns. Gwaine would wave his red cloth, and Percy would run at it, just as if it was a real bull fight. However, Gwaine wasn&#x27;t quick enough, and Percy tackled him to the ground. Both Merlin and Arthur laughed as Percy held up the red cloth in victory. He then jumped over the barrier separating the field from the seats, and ran up to Arthur and Merlin. “Here you go,” Percy said, and with a flourish, gave Arthur a small Spanish flag. “And off we go!” Merlin exclaimed, and led Arthur out of the stadium and back to the car. As they drove again, Arthur turned to Merlin and asked, “What are we doing?” “Travelling,” was the reply, “I know you want to on a big trip, but that’s not advisable this far along, so I decided to bring the destinations to you!” Once again, they came to a stop, but this time it was in front of a park. Instead of a walk, Merlin led him to a carriage and with a nod, they began clopping down the path. Arthur kept an eye out for a clue as to what they were doing here, but none came until they came to a stop. In front of a piñata in the shape of the Eiffel Tower. “I couldn’t find just a statue,” Merlin said, “And you can’t do France without the Eiffel Tower. But don’t worry, we’re not going to break it.” Arthur laughed and walked over to the paper mache landmark, “It’s very realistic,” he commented. “Now wait right there,” Merlin replied, and pulled out a disposable camera, “Can’t visit without a picture to remember it by!” Arthur just laughed harder, and missed the flash that went off. Merlin grabbed his hand, and dragged him down the path a little farther, where they met Gwen. All around her there were papers taped to the trees, threatening to escape with the breeze. “Welcome to the Louvre!” Gwen said, spreading her hands to encompass the pictures around her, “Please, no flash photography, as it can harm the paintings. If you’ll follow me, I’d be happy to give you a tour.” Gwen and Arthur walked around to each of the individual “paintings” and she told him the history and style of both the picture and the work. Merlin stood off to the side and watched smiling as they got into a deep discussion about one of the paintings. He was so lucky to have a partner as amazing as Arthur, and friends like Gwen, who put so much time into helping him do this for Arthur. “Merlin?” Arthur asked, cupping his neck, “Are you alright? You spaced out a little there.” Merlin just beamed back and replied, “Yeah I’m great. Ready for the next stop?” Arthur smiled and waved his little French flag in response. Arm in arm, the two of them went back to the carriage. On the way back to the car, Arthur rested his head on Merlin’s shoulder, absentmindedly twirling the flag in his fingers. “How did you know which paintings I wanted to see?” he asked suddenly, looking up at Merlin, who smiled softly. “I remembered you mentioning some of them,” he replied, “But Gwen picked out the rest.” Arthur squeezed Merlin’s hand. “Thank you,” he said. “We’ll go to the actual museum, I promise,” Merlin replied firmly, “I know this just isn’t the same.” “It was wonderful,” Arthur reassured him. “It’s not over yet!” Merlin reminded him, and helped him into the car, “Two more stops!” They heard their next destination before they saw it. The strains of Opera could be heard from down the street, and the two men just laughed. “Lance?” Arthur asked, and Merlin nodded. “I promise it’s not an opera though,” Merlin reassured him, “After that incident at Barber of Seville I know better.” Arthur looked abomished. “The insistence on silence is very modern! Excuse me for being traditional!” “Getting Gwaine to sneak a cat on stage? That’s traditional?” Merlin replied, shaking his head. “It happened the first performance,” Arthur defended. “Because it was being sabotaged!” Merlin exclaimed, “You could have just said that opera wasn’t really your thing, it really would have been sufficient.” Arthur just huffed as Merlin parked the car on the side of the road. Lance stood nearby with a boombox at his feet. He beamed at the couple as they got out of the car and turned off the music. The three of them walked over to the playground nearby. Arthur looked at the two of them, incredulous. “I know I’m pregnant, but the baby is still inside. You know that, right?” Merlin rolled his eyes as Lance replied, “We’re going on an archeological dig.” ***** “I found an Aphrodite!” Arthur exclaimed happily, holding up the small statue as proof. “Awesome!” Merlin replied happily, “Put him over there, next to my Athena.” Arthur did carefully, and examined their handiwork. They had found five statues of gods, ten pottery pieces, and eight glasses. All they had left was to uncover the village. He examined the remainder of the sandbox, searching for a good spot to continue digging. “I think I found it!” Merlin exclaimed, and motioned for Arthur to come over. Together with their brightly colored plastic shovels, buckets, and sieves, they began to dig in the right-hand corner of the box. Sure enough, they had found the village, complete with little people in their homes. The two of them beamed at each other, proud of all the hard work they had done in the sandbox for the past hour. “Congratulations!” Lance said, smiling, “Arthur, you’ve earned this,” and he handed him a small Italian flag. Together, Merlin and Arthur made their way back to the car, holding hands and laughing. “I can’t believe you arranged us to play in a sandbox,” Arthur laughed, still holding Merlin’s hand as he drove them to their final destination. “I didn’t,” Merlin admitted, smiling slightly, “I just asked Lance to do something Italian. I was expecting food.” “I had a lot of fun,” Arthur replied, “Where to next?” Merlin glanced over quickly and said, “What makes you think I’ll tell you? We’re almost there.” He parked the car by the river and a figure jogged up to open Arthur’s door. “Aloha!” Elyan said, grinning. He was wearing a bright pink Hawaiian shirt with flowers decorating them. He completed the ensemble with cargo shorts, flip flops, and a bucket hat. “Welcome to the exclusive resort!” he welcomed, throwing a lei around Arthur’s neck. He led them towards the water, where he had set up two lounging beach chairs. After helping Arthur into his, Merlin took his own seat, grinning. Around the chairs there were a few inflatable palm trees, a few tiki candles, and in front of the river there were two poles that were supporting a beach scene in between them. Elyan went behind the image and came out with drinks to give to both Arthur and Merlin. Merlin was about to ask Elyan about alcohol, which Arthur couldn’t have while pregnant, but Elyan answered before he even had a chance to ask. “It’s pineapple juice,” he explained, “No alcohol, but it can help with… other things,” and he winked before pulling a remote out of his pocket and pressing a button. Beach music filled the air and they laughed into their juice. “It wouldn’t be Hawaii without dancing,” Elyan said smirking, “I present to you now our favorite luau dancer!” From behind the beach scene came Leon, wearing a grass skirt and a coconut bra, his hair pulled back in a small bun. Merlin and Arthur howled in laughter as Leon seemed to prep himself, back facing them and standing up straighter. He turned around with as much flair as possible, exclaiming “Luau!” as excited as possible. He swayed his hips and waved his arms to the beat of the music. Merlin looked over at Arthur, who was laughing so hard that he was crying. Their eyes met, and they reached out and took each other’s hands. Arthur mouthed “Thank you, I love you,” and Merlin just mouthed “I love you too.” Then they turned their attention back to the show.</span> <a href="#" class="summary-toggle">[ + ]</a></div>

The only problem is that Arthur is in love with Guinevere. Arthur is head over heels in love with Merlin but is convinced the warlock is in love with Morgana, so Arthur is dating Guinevere to make them jealous. Merlin and Morgana aren’t in love, they just tend to pretend to make out to hide that they’re practicing magic together in secret Basically a fake dating au where both Merlin and Arthur are idiots (hence the &quot;the love is requited, they&#x27;re just idiots&quot; tag) Notes See the end of the work for notes There was a knock at the door of Arthur’s chambers. “Enter,” Arthur said, not looking up from his reading. Merlin glanced up at the door from where he was grabbing Arthur’s riding clothes. Gwen entered the room, head held high. “Your Highness,” Gwen said. “The Lady Morgana would like to coordinate outfits with you for the upcoming feast tomorrow.” Merlin looked up at Gwen, the blood draining from his face. He would undoubtedly have to help with all the last minute preparations of said feast. Gwen gave him a sympathetic smile. At least they would be working together. “What possessed Morgana to do that?” Arthur asked, putting down his scroll. “What color was she thinking?” “Emerald green, Your Highness,” Gwen said, curtseying. Arthur’s lip curled in disgust. “Of course she chose green,” he muttered. “Alright. Tell Morgana that that is acceptable. Have Merlin help you with the arrangements.” Merlin looked at Gwen, biting back a groan. “Yes, Your Highness,” Gwen replied with a curtsey before leaving the room. Merlin put down Arthur’s riding clothes and followed after her. If Arthur complained, he only had himself to blame. “So what does this all entail?” Merlin asked. “We find Arthur an outfit in emerald that matches Lady Morgana’s dress.” “That would be easier if Arthur wore anything that wasn’t red,” Merlin grumbled. Gwen laughed as they strode down the halls. “Luckily the tailors already know Arthur’s measurements, it won’t be hard to have something made quickly.” “Is anything quick and easy when it comes to Arthur?” Merlin asked, raising an eyebrow. Gwen laughed again, inclining her head towards Merlin. “Good point. He does have some charming features to him, though.” Merlin’s stomach twisted. A sudden annoyance toward Gwen arose in his chest but he quashed it down. He didn’t want to feel ill will towards her, but it still sat there like a curled dragon, waiting to catch him off guard again. Likely that night when sleep eluded him. “Right,” Merlin muttered under his breath, quiet enough that he thought Gwen wouldn’t hear. Gwen tilted her head and studied him before deciding to pretend she hadn’t heard. Gwen and Merlin passed hurried servants with arms full of decorations and cleaning supplies. “We might also have to help prepare for the feast itself. I will, at least, since Morgana already has a dress.” “I can help. It’ll get me away from Arthur for a while and I’ll be of use for something other than target practice.” Gwen gave a small snort of laughter. “Sorry,” she mumbled. “It’s alright, everyone knows how much of a royal prat Arthur is. I would expect nothing less.” Gwen smiled and shook her head before knocking at the tailor’s door. Entering the room, she said, “Prince Arthur needs a formal outfit for the feast tomorrow.” The tailor nodded wearily. “The usual red?” “No, he’ll be coordinating with Lady Morgana. Emerald green.” “I’ll see what I can do,” the tailor said. “Sorry,” Merlin said. The tailor gave Merlin a weak smile, the bags under his eyes weighing down his entire frame with exhaustion. “Is there something wrong?” Gwen asked, resting a hand on the tailor’s arm. “You seem more exhausted and harried than usual.” “The Lady Morgana convinced King Uther to reinstate the servants’ ball, so I’m working overtime to make items for the servants as well.” “I’m sorry,” Gwen said. “What’s the servants’ ball?” Merlin asked. “It’s a celebration for the servants after the regular feasting activities. A ‘thank you’ of sorts for all the hard work the servants do,” Gwen explained. Merlin nodded. “Is it required?” “Not necessarily, but there will be better food than you get otherwise and I’m requiring you to come with me. We’ll coordinate outfits. I’m thinking a nice blue.” Merlin smiled. “Well then I guess you’re in luck because blue’s my favorite color.” “I’m glad, because I embroidered you a cloak, so there’s no backing out now.” Merlin blanched. “A cloak?” Gwen nodded. “It has stars on it, just wait until you see it.” “This feast was announced today, when did you have the time to make me a cloak?” Gwen shrugged. “A girl gets bored, you know. Besides, I thought it would make a nice Yule gift.” “How did you know my measurements?” Gwen smiled, a mischievous twinkle in her eye. “A girl’s got to have her secrets, Merlin.” Merlin backed away slowly with wide eyes. Gwen laughed. “While you were out helping Arthur, I talked to Gaius. He let me into your room to get the measurements.” Merlin nodded despite his unease. What if she had seen his magic book? “Well, let’s leave the tailor to his work, there’s more to be done,” Gwen said. Merlin wordlessly followed her out and back into the bustling halls. “Do you have a dress for the servants’ ball?” Merlin asked. “I do. Lady Morgana gave it to me as a gift. It’s what inspired me to make your cloak.” “I’m flattered you made me a cloak,” Merlin said. “Of course,” Gwen said, hip checking Merlin. “We’re friends, that’s what friends do.” Merlin laughed. “Guess I better learn to sew, then,” he joked. “That’s unnecessary, but you could help me pick wildflowers to put around the castle,” Gwen said. Merlin nodded. “Sure.” “But for now, we have feast preparations and masters to tend to.” They strode down the halls quickly, Gwen rushing to a servant overburdened with boxes, grabbing the other side of the box. “Well, let’s get to work then,” Merlin said to himself, pushing up his sleeves. He lost Gwen in the commotion but he’d find her eventually. The feast, which was in full swing by then, was a boisterous affair. The bubbling anticipation of the servants’ ball was the only thing keeping all the servants awake as the party went on through the night. Morgana was certainly right, in emerald green, she and Arthur were a stunning picture of elegance and rivaled every other person at the party, even the dignitaries from the neighboring kingdom who had decided to descend upon Camelot so suddenly. But Arthur didn’t have eyes for Morgana. He kept looking over at where Merlin and Guinevere stood together, stunning visions in midnight blue, the lights of the candles catching on the gold and silver embroidered stars on their outfits. Merlin studied Arthur out of the corner of his eyes. Arthur’s gaze kept flitting to him and Gwen. He’s probably swooning over Gwen, Merlin thought bitterly as he filled goblets with wine. As the feasting ended, the band struck up a tune and the dancing began. Merlin watched the glittering nobles and their celebration, not able to do anything more than hold a wine pitcher and maybe shuffle his feet. Gwen bumped shoulders with him. “Cheer up, we’ll be dancing ourselves in a few hours.” “The food better be worth it,” Merlin grumbled. “It will be.” Eventually, the feast wound down and the nobles departed. Merlin helped Arthur undress and retire for the night, not bothering to take off his cloak. It was comfortable and smelled faintly of wildflowers. “Good night, Merlin,” Arthur said as Merlin snuffed out the candles. “Good night,” Merlin said, already on his way out the door. “That cloak suits you.” Merlin stopped, hand resting on the door handle. What was he supposed to say? “Thank you,” Merlin said before closing the door and walking away. He followed the groups of servants crackling with nervous excitement. They obviously knew the way. The less he had to think about where he was walking, the more he could ruminate on what Arthur had said. “Merlin,” Gwen said. He stopped walking, looking around. She popped up at his elbow, linking arms with him. “We have to make our grand entrance together.” Merlin nodded and let Gwen lead him through the castle. The servants’ ball wasn’t like the balls and feasts he was used to. It had the same food, cast offs and leftovers from the feast earlier in the evening, and everyone was dressed in their best, but there weren’t silver plates and a professional band, it was wooden trenchers and the cook had brought her harp. “We’re the best dressed here,” Merlin joked. “Of course we are, isn’t that the point?” Gwen and Merlin exchanged a grin. Gwen opened her hand to Merlin. “Shall we?” Merlin took her hand and let her lead him to the dance floor. They danced, Merlin letting Gwen lead, since she knew more about dancing than he did. They swirled through the dance floor much like Arthur and Morgana had earlier but a starry vision. End Notes This first chapter is short, but they&#x27;ll get longer as they go on This was the inspiration for Merlin’s cloak and Gwen’s dress bc why not You can find us at pirates-and-candles and thehotasfuckgay on tumblr.</span> <a href="#" class="summary-toggle">[ + ]</a></div>

Notes I&#x27;ve really enjoyed seeing Les Mis at the cinema, and this is my favourite song. Then I told my friend Blackthorn14 (Find her on DA, Tumblr etc!) that someone should rewrite the words for Arthur finding out about Merlin&#x27;s magic. Then I had a go and so did she, and some of her lines were much better than mine, and some of mine she preferred over hers; so I did a bit of cutting and copying and some tweaking here and there, and what you see before you is a more or less equal collaboration. Unfortunately neither of us can sing, but we were pretty pleased with how it turned out, so it seemed a shame not to post it up somewhere... Someone clever Merlin cosplayers need to record this for us. Please, talented people of the internet, do it! For best effect, try singing this along to the track :) We used the film version, though :) [ARTHUR] Merlin, at last, Your secret becomes plain A sorcerer And Camelot’s betrayed [MERLIN] Before you say another word, Arthur Before you send me to the stake to burn Listen to me!

Different sides- [ARTHUR] Merlin, stop it now! I&#x27;ve seen the things magic can do You deserve no trust from me A liar like you. [MERLIN(counterpoint)] Believe of me what you will This is something I had to do You don’t know what I’ve done All I did was save your life You know nothing I have done If not for me you would be dead My magic helped build Albion I am warning you Arthur You still need me by your side There is power in this world That you can’t face alone [ARTHUR(counterpoint)] You have tricked me all these years I considered you a friend No, It was all a lie How many men have I lost? How many fights? Come with me you sorcerer I’ll go on with my father’s deeds Our friendship means nothing now No mercy for scum like you You belong inside a jail All these years you’ve lived a lie You have treated me as a fool How could you keep this from me?

Notes Thanks to my wonderful sister kaseyboy for being my beta again. You&#x27;re the best! This is now my second mute Merlin story. I seem to only be able to write stories with him either being deaf or mute. I don&#x27;t know why. Please forgive any errors I&#x27;ve made about muteness and sign language. I hope you enjoy and comments are greatly appreciated. -- -- Arthur met Merlin through his sister Morgana. Merlin was a graphic designer in the marketing department of Pendragon Industries and Morgana was his boss. He had been working there for nearly a year and everyone, including Uther, was impressed with his work. Arthur was now back in London after having spent the past couple of years traveling for the company. He was VP and would one day run the company once his father, Uther, retired. He hadn&#x27;t minded the traveling until Morgana married Leon, his best friend, about four months ago. He saw how incredibly happy they were together and it made him want more than the life he was leading, coming back to an empty hotel room every night. Arthur wanted someone to keep him in London. He wanted someone to come home to every night and talk to about his day. He wanted to find love. -------- Arthur went down to the cafeteria to grab a quick sandwich for lunch when he saw his sister with a gorgeous young guy. After he remembered to breath, he paid for his food and walked over to where the two were sitting. Before he had a chance to say anything, Morgana saw him. &quot;Arthur, it&#x27;s so nice to see you. Sit down.&quot; After he did she said, &quot;I&#x27;d like to introduce you to Merlin and Merlin, this is my brother Arthur.&quot; Both men smiled at each other and Arthur reached out to shake his hand. When their hands touched, Arthur was afraid he&#x27;d let out an audible gasp. It was like an electric current went up his arm and settled warmly inside his body. It was right after they touched that Arthur discovered Merlin was mute and communicated with sign language. This really wasn&#x27;t a problem for Arthur because he already knew sign since his mother had been deaf. The two became fast friends, which was nice, but Arthur wanted more than just a friendship with Merlin. So after about a month, Arthur asked Merlin out on a date which he quickly accepted. -------- Arthur and Merlin had been dating for four months when they confessed their love for each other. It was that same night that they slept together for the first time and it was magical. Merlin wasn&#x27;t very experienced so Arthur took it nice and slow, being extremely gentle with him. -------- Almost every Thursday night, Arthur and Merlin met up at the pub with their now shared friends Morgana, Leon, Gwen, Lance, Gwaine, Elena and sometimes Percy and Mithian. It was Thursday, a few days after they slept together for the first time, when Arthur texted Merlin during lunch. &quot;Sorry, but I have too much work to get done for this merger, I won&#x27;t be able to go tonight.&quot; &quot;That&#x27;s okay, we&#x27;ll go next week,&quot; Merlin texted back. &quot;No, just because I have to work doesn&#x27;t mean you shouldn&#x27;t go.&quot; Merlin replied with, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to go without you.&quot; &quot;You go and have fun. I&#x27;ll see you tomorrow night at the party.&quot; &quot;Ok but I&#x27;ll miss you.&quot; &quot;I&#x27;ll miss you too. Have fun. Love you,&quot; Arthur texted and when he saw Merlin&#x27;s texted &quot;love you too,&quot; he put his phone down to get back to work. -------- Arthur finished work earlier than expected so he headed straight to the pub to surprise Merlin. When he walked in it was more crowded than usual but after looking around for a minute he spotted Merlin. He smiled to himself but before he had a chance to walk over to him, he watched as Merlin reached up and put his hands on some guy&#x27;s chest as he was pulling Merlin close for a sloppy kiss. Stunned, Arthur&#x27;s eyes narrowed and he turned and walked out of the pub before Merlin or anyone else saw him. What Arthur missed by leaving so quickly was Merlin&#x27;s knee going into the guy&#x27;s groin causing him to let go of him. The bloke that Arthur saw kissing Merlin was Valiant, a guy that also worked at Pendragon Industries but in another department. He was always trying to get Merlin to go out with him but he always refused. Valiant was drunk and still couldn&#x27;t seem to take no for an answer so he forced himself on Merlin. Gwaine and Percy rushed over and shoved him away from Merlin and out of the club and told Valiant to stay away from him. By the time Arthur got to his flat, he was furious. &quot;How could he do this to me,&quot; he kept repeating to himself. He quickly downed several shots before he crawled into bed. He was physically, mentally and emotionally exhausted and fell asleep almost instantly. -------- &quot;how was work. did you get everything done?&quot; Merlin texted Arthur late Friday morning. When Arthur saw the text, he just glared at his phone and was tempted to throw it across his office but he restrained himself. Instead, he just ignored it along with the other three messages he&#x27;d received from Merlin throughout the day. Merlin wasn&#x27;t really too concerned that Arthur didn&#x27;t respond to any of his texts. He knew he had a lot going and was probably just too busy to respond. He knew he&#x27;d see him tonight at the party Uther was throwing for his employees as a thank you for their hard work. It was an annual event and no expense was spared. -------- Morgana stopped into Arthur&#x27;s office in the late afternoon to ask him something about the party but he just brushed her off. &quot;I still have lots of work to do on this merger so if you don&#x27;t mind, I don&#x27;t have time to deal with your little party issues.&quot; &quot;You don&#x27;t have to be such an arse,&quot; she said back as she left his office and slammed the door shut behind her. He wasn&#x27;t really busy, he had finished the work last night but he was pissed at her for not bothering to tell him that Merlin was cheating on him. He was her brother, she should have told him. -------- Arthur and Merlin had previously agreed to meet at the banquet hall that Uther always reserved for the occasion because Uther expected him and Morgana to be there well in advance of anyone else. The siblings managed to avoid each other, which really wasn&#x27;t too difficult considering the fact that Morgana was still angry at Arthur from earlier in the day and Arthur was obviously furious with her. Arthur was already at the bar when Merlin showed up. He didn&#x27;t see Arthur right away but Arthur saw him and moved over to talk to Cendred, a bloke he&#x27;d dated a few years ago. Merlin was soon greeted by Morgana. &quot;Have you seen Arthur?&quot; he signed to her. &quot;No, but I really haven&#x27;t looked for him. I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;s around here somewhere,&quot; she said as they both scanned the crowd. &quot;Oh, there he is, at the bar.&quot; As Merlin approached Arthur, he heard him talking to Cendred. &quot;So how&#x27;s the little boyfriend?&quot; Cendred asked sarcastically. &quot;Who, Merlin?&quot; &quot;Yeah.&quot; &quot;That&#x27;s totally over. I got what I wanted and now I&#x27;m done with him,&quot; he said loud enough so Merlin could hear. Merlin stopped dead in his tracks. He couldn&#x27;t believe what Arthur was saying. Arthur turned around and glared at Merlin as he said to Cendred, &quot;why, you interested?&quot; &quot;Hell yeah,&quot; and he slid closer to Arthur who pulled him flush against himself and started giving Cendred open mouthed kisses as he looked Merlin directly in the eyes. Merlin was frozen to the spot as the tears started to pool in his eyes. He needed to get out of there now. He turned and rushed to the loo since it was closer than the exit. He went into a stall so he could try to gather his composure before anyone saw him. Unfortunately, he was spotted by Valiant who quickly followed him into the loo. Arthur watched Valiant follow Merlin, which pissed him off even more. Obviously Merlin&#x27;s &quot;other boyfriend&quot; was going in to comfort him. He pushed Cendred away and left without saying anything to anyone. Merlin didn&#x27;t hear Valiant enter because he was trying to get his breathing under control and fighting to stop the tears. As he opened the stall door, Valiant pushed his way into the stall with Merlin. &quot;So Merlin, we meet again,&quot; he sneered. He was still furious about the night before when Merlin kneed him in the groin. Merlin was in a panic. He had to get out of the stall and away but before he could even start to fight back, Valiant punched him in the face. This was quickly followed by more blows to the face and several to the ribs before he managed to turn Merlin around and shove him against the side of the stall face first. Before he could go any farther, Gwaine walked in. Gwaine didn&#x27;t know who was in the stall but he saw blood on the floor and heard struggling so he kicked the door in which knocked Valiant off Merlin. Merlin fell to the floor now that there was nothing holding him up. Gwaine pulled Valiant out of the stall and yelled for help. Thankfully, Percy was heading to the loo and rushed in. As he saw Gwaine fighting Valiant, he grabbed him from behind and yanked Valiant&#x27;s arm high up behind his back as he put his other arm around his neck before he saw Merlin laying on the floor of the stall. Gwaine rushed over to him and fell to his knees. &quot;Merlin, Merlin, are you okay?! Merlin! Wake up!&quot; He was panicked so Percy kept his hold on Valiant as he shoved him out the door so he could yell for more help. Two security guards came and took Valiant from Percy and called the cops. By this time, all Merlin&#x27;s friends had filled the loo and everyone in the banquet hall knew something terrible had happened. Merlin finally woke up much to his friend&#x27;s great relief and Gwaine and Leon were able to get him up. &quot;We need to get him to the hospital,&quot; Leon said. &quot;Where&#x27;s Arthur?&quot; Morgana asked but no one was able to answer because no one knew where he&#x27;d disappeared to. She rushed out ahead of them to get to her car. Leon and Gwaine led Merlin outside and to Morgana&#x27;s car, which she had at the curb waiting for them. She was on the phone leaving Arthur a message as Gwaine and Leon slowly climbed in the back with Merlin. Everyone inside the hall was shocked and sickened after not only knowing it was Merlin that had been attacked but seeing his bruised and bloody body being helped out by his friends. -------- Morgana and everyone else tried to get in touch with Arthur once they were at the hospital but their calls just kept going straight to voice mail. They were all unaware of the fact that Arthur left the party to go home where he proceeded to get drunk. After the first call he got from Morgana, Arthur turned off his phone without even listening to it. Morgana left him a second message telling him to &quot;call as soon as you get this. Merlin has been hurt. We&#x27;re at the hospital.&quot; From Leon: &quot;Hey man, I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing but call Morgana or me when you get this message.&quot; From Gwaine: &quot;Listen you arse, Merlin&#x27;s hurt and needs you. Where the fuck are you?!&quot; From Morgana: &quot;Arthur why the fuck aren&#x27;t you answering your phone! Call me back!&quot; The friends also tried texting Arthur. Morgana: Call me now!!!!!! Gwaine: where the fuck r u !! Leon: Arthur we took Merlin to A&amp;E. Come as soon as you can Morgana: get your fucking ass over here. Merlin needs you Gwaine: FUCK YOU PENDRAGON -------- Merlin was admitted to the hospital and taken to surgery to repair the broken jaw he suffered. He also had a concussion caused by Valiant slamming his head against the wall of the stall and several cracked ribs. As soon as he was out of surgery and moved to a private room, thanks to Morgana, Leon went to Arthur&#x27;s flat since no one had heard from him yet. -------- Arthur woke up to pounding on his door at six in the morning. He could hear Leon yelling something but he put his pillow over his head and fell back to sleep because his head was pounding. When Leon told Morgana that Arthur never answered his door, they both were worried that something had happened to him. -------- Around ten in the morning, Arthur once again heard someone banging on his door. He then heard Morgana&#x27;s voice yelling at him to open the door. He managed to get out of bed long enough to yell at her to &quot;fuck off&quot; before he crawled back in bed. He was quite sure she was there to bitch at him for making Merlin cry and he didn&#x27;t want to hear it from his traitor sister. She was furious with him but relieved to know that he was at least okay. She&#x27;d deal with him later but right now she needed to be with Merlin. No one else knocked on Arthur&#x27;s door for the rest of the weekend. Saturday night, when he finally turned his phone back on, the first text he saw was from Gwaine, &quot;FUCK YOU PENDRAGON&quot; so he deleted it plus the rest of his texts and voice mails without reading or listening to them. How dare Merlin involve their friends and have them harass him. -------- Monday morning when Arthur showed up at work he got a few surprised looks from people but no one approached him. He was still angry with Merlin and his friends and apparently the scowl he wore on his face made everyone avoid him. He spent the morning locked in his office. When he left to go to lunch he was stopped by several people asking him how Merlin was doing. Arthur and Merlin hadn&#x27;t flaunted their relationship but he knew people were aware of it. He was annoyed that everyone seemed so concerned about Merlin just because of what Arthur had done Friday night. They obviously didn&#x27;t know what their beloved Merlin had done to him the night before so his response was either, &quot;how should I know,&quot; or &quot;I don&#x27;t really care.&quot; Each of which brought looks of shock or anger or disgust. When he returned from lunch, he got more of the same questions so he stormed straight to Morgana&#x27;s office. When he got there, her PA told him she took the day off and then told him she was surprised he was there. &quot;And why wouldn&#x27;t I be here today,&quot; he demanded. &quot;I just figured, with everything that happened, you&#x27;d be at the hospital,&quot; the PA said. &quot;I have no idea what you&#x27;re talking about. Why would I be at the hospital?&quot; &quot;Well, I thought since Merlin was there, you&#x27;d...&quot; but she stopped herself before she said anymore fearing it could end up getting her fired. Arthur stormed back to his office where he slammed his door shut before he called Morgana. After six rings, she finally answered. &quot;Where are you and what the hell is going on?!&quot; &quot;Oh Arthur, so nice of you to finally call,&quot; she said with such fake sweetness it just angered him more. &quot;What the hell is going on?!&quot; &quot;Oh, so you want to act like you&#x27;re interested now?&quot; &quot;Morgana, tell me what&#x27;s going on,&quot; he growled. &quot;Well, let&#x27;s see. Merlin got through surgery and they should be releasing him soon.&quot; &quot;What the fuck are you talking about? Why did he have surgery? Where are you?&quot; &quot;Sorry, but I can&#x27;t talk anymore. The doctor&#x27;s coming.&quot; She hung up leaving him worried and confused and feeling sick. He still had no idea what was going on so he called Leon. &quot;Leon, please tell me what&#x27;s going on,&quot; he rushed out almost in a panic. &quot;Well hello to you too Arthur,&quot; Leon snapped because he was angry at Arthur&#x27;s lack of concern for Merlin. Arthur knew it must be something bad if Leon was talking to him like that. &quot;Leon, please, I just want to know what&#x27;s going on,&quot; he pleaded. &quot;Friday night Merlin was attacked by Valiant in the loo. He really did a number on him. He broke his jaw, cracked several ribs and gave him a concussion,&quot; he told him sadly. &quot;No,&quot; Arthur whispered. &quot;They had to do surgery on his jaw that night but Morgana told me a short time ago that they were going to release him from the hospital today, which is good. He looks like shit though. When I saw him last night, the swelling in his left eye still hadn&#x27;t gone down much. His lip is still swollen and he&#x27;s probably going to have a scar or two from where Valiant&#x27;s ring sliced into him. He&#x27;s really sore and having trouble moving because of his ribs but other than that, he&#x27;s fine,&quot; he finished sarcastically. Arthur collapsed in his chair trying to just breath. &#x27;This can&#x27;t be happening,&#x27; he said to himself. Finally, he gathered his composure enough to ask Leon what hospital he was in before he rushed out of his office. By the time he got to the hospital, Merlin had already been released. He assumed Morgana probably took Merlin back to his own flat, not really thinking, so he rushed there. After spending several minutes banging on Merlin&#x27;s door, he realized Morgana must have taken him somewhere else so he called her. &quot;Morgana, where is he?&quot; he demanded. &quot;No, I&#x27;m not telling you. The last thing he needs right now is to get upset so just stay away from him. I think you&#x27;ve done more than enough damage as it is,&quot; she said before she hung up. Arthur sat in his car and put his head on the steering wheel and cried. Merlin was hurt and even though he was cheating on him, he still needed to see him so he went to Morgana&#x27;s. She wasn&#x27;t there so he just sat outside her door to wait until she returned. It was around five when she finally showed up looking tired. &quot;What are you doing here?&quot; she asked him as she unlocked her door and went inside. &quot;I need to see him, please,&quot; Arthur said as he followed her in. &quot;No, I don&#x27;t think you do. I believe you hurt him enough already by making out with Cendred right in front of him.&quot; &quot;I was only doing that to get even with him.&quot; &quot;Get even with him for what?!&quot; &quot;For cheating on me and don&#x27;t even try to act like you don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m talking about.&quot; &quot;I have no fucking idea what you&#x27;re talking about?!&quot; she yelled as Leon walked into the flat. &quot;I saw him all over some guy at the pub!&quot; Arthur shouted. &quot;What are you talking about?!&quot; she yelled again. &quot;Oh come on Morgana, I saw him!&quot; &quot;When!&quot; &quot;Thursday night, as soon as I finished with work, I went to the pub and saw him and some guy all over each other. It was really nice of you and Leon to not tell me my boyfriend was cheating on me!&quot; &quot;Oh my god, are you kidding me?!&#x27;&#x27; She knew instantly what he was talking about. &quot;Did you also happen to see Merlin knee him in the groin to make him let him go?! Oh, and, by the way, that was Valiant, the same guy that beat him up Friday.&quot; &quot;What?&quot; &quot;He wanted to get revenge on Merlin for what he did to him on Thursday night.&quot; &quot;But...no! I saw him follow Merlin into the loo on Friday. I just thought he was going in there to...No! Oh my god! I watched him go in there so he could hurt Merlin and I just let him.&quot; He fell to the floor and sobbed knowing he could have prevented the whole thing. Morgana kneeled down beside him and put her arms around him. &quot;Arthur, you were an idiot but you had no idea Valiant was going to hurt Merlin. You can&#x27;t blame yourself for that.&quot; When Arthur got himself under control, the brother and sister stood up and sat on the sofa. A minute later Leon came in with three cups of tea. They all sat there in silence until Arthur finally asked, &quot;where is he?&quot; &quot;Listen, if I tell you, you have to promise you won&#x27;t go see him, at least not right now.&quot; &quot;No, I have to see him. I have to make sure he&#x27;s okay for myself. I have to tell him how sorry I am. Please Morgana.&quot; Morgana looked over at Leon and he gave her a small nod. &quot;Okay, but listen, I&#x27;m going to go with you and if Merlin doesn&#x27;t want to see you then you have to promise you&#x27;ll leave.&quot; &quot;I promise.&quot; -------- Morgana drove Arthur to Gwen and Lance&#x27;s flat. &#x27;Of course,&#x27; he thought to himself. He should have known that was where Merlin would be. Before Morgana left, she had whispered to Leon to call Gwen to warn them that they were coming over. She wanted Gwen to be able to talk to Merlin and check if he wanted to see Arthur or not. As soon as Gwen answered the door, she told them Merlin was sleeping, which he was because of the pain medication he was on. &quot;Can I go and see him? I promise I won&#x27;t wake him,&quot; Arthur asked quietly. &quot;Go on, he&#x27;s in the guest room,&quot; Gwen told him. -------- Arthur slowly pushed the guest room door open. The room was fairly dark because the blinds were closed but even in the dim light, he could see Merlin&#x27;s battered face and it knocked the breath right out of him. It took a minute before he was able to walk into the room. The light from the hall landed on Merlin&#x27;s face which made it possible for him to see the bruises, cuts and swelling more clearly and it made him nauseous. He just looked down at Merlin&#x27;s abused face while tears streamed down his cheeks. Finally, he kneeled by the side of the bed and reached out to hold Merlin&#x27;s hand. With his other hand he very gently moved Merlin&#x27;s hair off his forehead and leaned up and kissed it tenderly. That kiss was followed by many more gentle kisses to all the injuries on his face. &quot;I&#x27;m so sorry Merlin. I&#x27;m so so sorry. I love you so much. I just hope you&#x27;ll be able to forgive me some day.&quot; He then rested his head on the side of the bed never releasing Merlin&#x27;s hand and cried. Arthur didn&#x27;t know that Gwen and Morgana were outside the room and witnessed the tenderness he displayed towards Merlin. They finally walked away to give him some privacy. Merlin never woke up while Arthur was sitting with him which he was both grateful for and sad about. He wanted to tell him how sorry he was and how much he loved him but he was afraid of the reaction Merlin would have from seeing him. After a few hours he got up and left the room asking Gwen if he could come back and see him in the morning. &quot;I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a very good idea. Just give me time to talk to him first,&quot; Gwen told him. &quot;Okay, but can I call you in the morning to check on him?&quot; &quot;Of course.&quot; Morgana had already left so he went outside and walked around for a while before he called a cab to take him home. -------- Arthur didn&#x27;t get to see Merlin at all that whole week. Gwen tried to spare his feelings by telling him that Merlin didn&#x27;t want to see anyone. Arthur knew it was just him that Merlin didn&#x27;t want to see because Morgana was keeping him updated on his progress. She told him he was still in a lot of pain and was getting antsy and wanted to go back to his own flat and back to work but the doctors wanted him to take another week off. Actually, Morgana was keeping everyone updated by sending the staff daily emails regarding Merlin. She said it was much easier doing it that way because she was repeatedly being stopped throughout the day by coworkers wanting to know how Merlin was. After Monday, no one had wasted their time asking Arthur how Merlin was. He assumed word of his initial replies to those inquiries on Monday had spread and now they all probably thought he was a heartless bastard. -------- The second week was much the same as the first. Gwen would come up with some excuse or another as to why he couldn&#x27;t see Merlin. Arthur sent him a text each day but never got a reply back. He also sent flowers and even talked to a doctor to see what kinds of foods Merlin could eat and then had that delivered to him. -------- Merlin finally returned to work the following Monday. Arthur wanted to go see him but it was like a zoo around him most of the day with coworkers coming to see him to tell him how glad they were that he was back and how much they missed him. Arthur stayed in the background and watched as people would smile as soon as they spotted him, which made Arthur&#x27;s heart warm knowing so many people cared about and adored Merlin. When he finally got a clear view of him, Arthur saw that the swelling and bruising was almost totally gone. He still had a bandage covering up the stitches he had on his chin and cheek and was moving slowly but he looked happy to be back. Tuesday, Arthur went down to Merlin&#x27;s department just before lunch hoping to catch him alone. When Merlin spotted him, he quickly put his head down and acted busy. It was clear that this wasn&#x27;t going to be easy. &quot;Hey, how&#x27;re you feeling?&quot; Arthur asked him. &quot;Better,&quot; Merlin signed back without making any eye contact with him. &quot;I&#x27;m glad. Um, do you think we could go somewhere and talk?&quot; Arthur asked hesitantly. Merlin shook his head no then signed, &quot;I&#x27;ve got a lot of work to get caught up on.&quot; &quot;Oh, okay. I guess I&#x27;ll let you get back to it then.&quot; As he turned to walk away, he added, &quot;I&#x27;m really glad you&#x27;re back,&quot; and then left. Once Arthur was back in his own office, he shut the door, sat down and put his head in his hands. He felt like crying knowing Merlin didn&#x27;t want anything to do with him. After Arthur left him, Merlin slowly made his way to the loo so he could try to regain his composure. It was so hard seeing Arthur and he hadn&#x27;t been ready for it. Arthur continued to make attempts to talk to Merlin but he wasn&#x27;t successful. -------- Three months had passed since Arthur broke Merlin&#x27;s heart and he was desperate to talk to him so he went to Morgana to ask if he could join them for their weekly pub night. She didn&#x27;t give him an answer right away because she wanted to check with Merlin to see if he was alright with the idea. After she&#x27;d talked to Merlin, she told Arthur it&#x27;d be okay if he came. ------- Over the next several weeks, Arthur slowly started trying to engage Merlin in conversations. They started off with small talk and one word answers but at least it was a start and Arthur could feel the ice beginning to melt just the tiniest bit between them. On one of their weekly trips to the pub, Arthur watched as a bloke came over to Merlin and tried to talk to him but Merlin just shook his head and tried to walk away. The guy then grabbed Merlin by the shoulder and swung him around roughly but before it went any farther than that, Arthur was there between the two of them shoving the man away from Merlin. After they exchanged a few words, the man left and Arthur turned around to face Merlin. &quot;Are you okay? Did he hurt you?&quot; Arthur asked. Merlin shook his head no but looked a little shaken so Arthur put his arm on the small of Merlin&#x27;s back and led him back over to their table. When Merlin sat down, Arthur took the seat beside him. They were both quieter than normal after that but if their friends noticed, no one mentioned it. When Merlin was getting ready to leave for the night, he gave Arthur a sad smile and signed thanks. Arthur wasn&#x27;t about to let him walk out of the pub alone because he didn&#x27;t know where the guy from earlier was and he wasn&#x27;t willing to risk Merlin&#x27;s safety. As Merlin was standing, he noticed Arthur stand also. When he looked at Arthur giving him a questioning look, Arthur just grinned and shrugged his shoulders and walked out with Merlin and led him over to a taxi to ensure he made it home safely. Merlin gave him a small wave which he returned before heading back inside the pub to rejoin their friends. Merlin had a hard time falling asleep that night. He kept replaying the events of the night over and over in his head. He could almost still feel the warmth of Arthur&#x27;s hand on his back. He was so confused. He thought he was getting over Arthur but now he was doubting that. Maybe he had just been fooling himself all this time thinking he was getting over him. -------- Merlin missed their next couple weeks of pub nights. He told Morgana it was because he had a lot of things he needed to get caught up on but Arthur secretly thought it had more to do with what happened with their last encounter. Arthur had stayed away from Merlin at work per Morgana&#x27;s request but he had at least that one night a week where he could see and try to talk to Merlin but with his absence, Arthur was going crazy. He missed Merlin so much. -------- Gwen was having a party to celebrate Lance&#x27;s birthday. It was a large gathering outside their building in the patio area with lots of people Arthur didn&#x27;t know. Arthur spotted Merlin off to the side signing with Owen, a guy from work. Arthur was concerned that maybe he and Merlin had gotten together so he sought Gwen out. Before he could find her, a blonde bloke approached him and put his arm over his shoulder before whispering in his ear asking him to dance. Arthur removed the guy&#x27;s arm as he shook his head and continued his search for Gwen. Unbeknownst to him, Merlin had been watching the encounter and grinned to himself when he saw Arthur walk away from he guy. When Arthur finally located Gwen, she explained that, no, Merlin and Owen weren&#x27;t together, just friends. Arthur let out a deep sigh of relief. Gwen gave him a small smile and patted him on the arm before she returned to her other guests. She and the rest of their friends had finally forgiven him for hurting Merlin. When Arthur next saw Merlin, he was standing off to the side watching people dancing to a slow song with such a sadness and longing in his eyes that it broke Arthur&#x27;s heart. He walked up to Merlin and asked, &quot;will you dance with me?&quot; Merlin looked at him with sad eyes and shook his head no before he looked down to the floor. Arthur wasn&#x27;t about to give up so easily. He hesitantly reached out and lifted Merlin&#x27;s chin to get him to look at him. &quot;Please,&quot; he mouthed as he was giving Merlin puppy dog eyes. Merlin hesitated and Arthur took advantage of his indecision and again asked, &quot;pretty please?&quot; This drew a grin out of Merlin. Arthur slowly reached out and took his hand as he looked at him more serious this time. &quot;Please,&quot; he said again looking so hopeful, Merlin finally relented and allowed Arthur to lead him over, but off to the side, of where everyone was dancing. When Arthur pulled Merlin into him, like he had done so many times before, it felt right. Oh how he had longed to have this back. He held on to Merlin like his life depended on it. Before he even realized it, he had tears running down his cheeks and soaking into Merlin&#x27;s shoulder. Merlin pulled back a little and looked at Arthur&#x27;s face. He slowly lifted his hands and gently wiped the tears off his cheeks with his fingers and gave him another sad smile. Arthur pulled him close again not wanting to give up the closeness. He was relieved Merlin let him. Before either of them had even realized it, twenty minutes had passed and the people that were still dancing were now jumping around to the song now playing while they were still clinging to each other just swaying in each other&#x27;s arms. Finally, Merlin started to pull away a little which brought Arthur back to reality. He looked at Merlin and gave him a sheepish grin before he released his hold on Merlin and then led him away from the dance floor keeping his hand on Merlin&#x27;s back. When they reached the other side of the patio area, Arthur asked him if he&#x27;d like a beer and when Merlin nodded yes, he left to fetch them both one before returning to Merlin. Arthur knew their friends were secretly watching them but was thankful no one came over to interfere. Arthur handed Merlin his beer before he asked, &quot;can we please talk? There&#x27;s so much I need to say to you.&quot; Merlin looked at him nervously. He didn&#x27;t know if he was ready to be alone with Arthur and listen to what he had to say yet. But Arthur&#x27;s next &quot;please&quot; broke any remaining resistance he had. Arthur led him up to Gwen and Lance&#x27;s flat. He didn&#x27;t want any interruptions so he took him to their guest room so they&#x27;d have privacy if someone else came into the flat. When they reached the spare room, Arthur led Merlin over to the bed to sit and put both their beers on the dresser. He then kneeled down in front of Merlin so he could see him clearly. &quot;I am so so sorry I hurt you. There is absolutely no excuse for what I did. There is no way you could hate me more than I hate myself. I love you so much. I know I have no right to ask this of you, but can you ever forgive me?&quot; Merlin looked at him for a minute before he signed, &quot;I can forgive you in time but I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll be able to forget what I heard you say and what I saw you do.&quot; He now had tears running down his face. &quot;I thought you loved me but then you said and did those things.&quot; Arthur tried to respond but Merlin waved him off and continued. &quot;I always thought you were out of my league and I couldn&#x27;t believe you would ever be interested in me, but then, the longer we were together, I started to believe it was real and that maybe you did love me. Then when I heard you say you got what you wanted and was done with me, I felt so stupid and humiliated.&quot; He had to stop to wipe his eyes of their tears. &quot;You used me and made me feel dirty and worthless. I loved you more than anything and then you did that to me. You got what you wanted and then just threw me away like a piece of trash.&quot; Arthur couldn&#x27;t take it anymore. He reached up and held Merlin&#x27;s hands to still them before he spoke. &quot;Oh my god Merlin, please, I love you so much. I swear I wasn&#x27;t using you. Please, you have to believe me. You mean more to me than life itself. I am so so sorry. I would do anything to be able to turn back time and erase what I did.&quot; &quot;Why did you do it then?&quot; he signed. Morgana had already told him how Arthur had misinterpreted what he&#x27;d seen that Thursday night with Valiant in the pub but all Morgana knew was that Arthur had kissed Cendred right in front of Merlin. She only knew that much because other people had witnessed it and told her about it. She didn&#x27;t know anything about what Arthur said to him because Merlin had never told her or anyone else because he was too embarrassed and humiliated. &quot;That night, I went to find you at the pub because I finished work early. When I walked in, I thought you were kissing Valiant...&quot; &#x27;But I wasn&#x27;t. I would never do that to you.&quot; &quot;I know that but, at that moment, I just was so angry and jealous, I lost it. I wanted to hurt you the same way I was hurting.&quot; Arthur looked down at the floor for a minute before looking back up at Merlin. &quot;I&#x27;m so sorry. You are the most important thing in the world to me. I&#x27;m willing to do anything to get you back. I love you so much.&quot; He was crying by this time and leaned over to rest his head against Merlin&#x27;s knee. Finally, he felt fingers running through his hair and after a minute of savoring the feel of it, he hesitantly pulled back and looked up at Merlin who signed, &quot;I don&#x27;t know if I can trust you again. You broke my heart. How do I know you won&#x27;t do it again?&quot; &quot;I swear to you I will never hurt you again. I would rather die than cause you any more pain. Please believe me.&quot; When Merlin made no response, Arthur continued, &quot;I love you Merlin and I will do anything it takes to get you to trust me again and to prove to you that I do love you.&quot; Merlin still didn&#x27;t respond. He just stared at Arthur fighting an internal battle with himself. Part of him really wanted to believe Arthur but the other part just kept replaying the words Arthur had spoken to him that night. &quot;Can we try again? Please?&quot; Arthur signed. Merlin looked at him and saw the sincerity in his eyes and signed, &quot;maybe we can try being friends.&quot; It wasn&#x27;t what Arthur was hoping for but it was so much better than it could have been so he counted it as a small victory. He stood up and then pulled Merlin up and into his arms. He knew he might be pushing it but he just had to feel him in his arms again. Merlin didn&#x27;t seem to mind the closeness either because he relaxed into the hug. ------ A few months after Lance&#x27;s birthday party, Merlin and Arthur were friends again. Arthur wanted more but Merlin just couldn&#x27;t get over his trust issues with Arthur so whenever Arthur broached the subject of them going on a date, Merlin declined. Arthur was determined not to lose hope, after all, he was the cause of this. He patiently waited for the day Merlin would be able to look at him and not see him as the man that had broken his heart, but instead, as the man who was willing to wait for him no matter how long it took. Over the following months, he sat back and waited. He knew Merlin was his soul mate and even though it killed him not to be able to hold or kiss him, he held onto the belief and hope that one day soon, Merlin would realize that too. It took nearly six months for Merlin to finally see that man. Arthur hadn&#x27;t pushed but he had been there making Merlin laugh, buying him coffee and then surprising him by delivering it to his desk, showing up at his flat with take-out when he knew Merlin had had a bad day and he&#x27;d most likely forget to eat, offering him support and a shoulder to cry on when his Mum was very ill and in the hospital. He was also there when Merlin went to the store to buy a new suit for Gwen and Lance&#x27;s wedding. He helped pick out a shirt that showed off his beautiful eyes. When Merlin came out of the dressing room, Arthur was standing there with a tie for him to try on but, instead of handing it to Merlin to put on himself, he stepped close to Merlin, flipped his collar up, reached around him to grab the other end of the tie before he carefully tied it just right. When he reached up to flip the collar back down, he didn&#x27;t remove his hands. He looked deep into Merlin&#x27;s eyes and moved his hands just enough so he could gently stroke Merlin&#x27;s cheekbones. When Merlin took a startled gasp but didn&#x27;t pull away, Arthur leaned in and pressed his lips to Merlin&#x27;s. He pulled back a few inches but when Merlin made no attempt to retreat, he cupped his face in his hands and kissed him like it was the only thing that would keep him alive. He didn&#x27;t realize until they broke apart that they both had tears streaming down their faces. He gave Merlin a warm smile as he carefully wipes the tears from his face and then pulled him in for another kiss that ended with them just holding each other in the middle of the dressing area. When they parted, they looked at each other and they had matching grins on their faces. Arthur smoothed down Merlin&#x27;s shirt before he stepped back and looked him up and down, &quot;you look absolutely gorgeous. Merlin, will you be my date for the wedding?&quot; Merlin smiled even brighter and nodded yes. Arthur pulled him in for another hug and ended with a quick kiss before Merlin turned and retreated back into the dressing rooms. Arthur felt like he was floating on air. He wanted to shout at the top of his lungs and throw his arms in the air proclaiming victory. He had just won the best prize in the world, Merlin. As soon as Merlin emerged with his clothes, Arthur took them up to the counter and told the shop assistant they&#x27;d be back later in the week to pick everything up after the alterations were complete. He then lead Merlin outside where he couldn&#x27;t help himself. There, in the middle of the street, he pulled him in for another kiss and hug. Once they&#x27;d broken apart, Arthur whispered, &quot;I love you so much.&quot; He would&#x27;ve loved more than anything to drop down on one knee and propose to Merlin right then and there but he knew it was too soon. He did know that it would happen this time though. He was never letting go of Merlin again. In the weeks leading up to the wedding, Merlin and Arthur started going on real dates. Arthur would pick him up and take him to dinner. Merlin was still a little apprehensive so Arthur was more than willing to take it slow for Merlin. They decided not to tell their friends just yet. They wanted to wait until after the wedding because they didn&#x27;t want to take any attention away from Gwen and Lance as their big day approached. Arthur and Merlin sat beside each other during the wedding ceremony. Arthur reached over ever so slyly to hold Merlin&#x27;s hand. At the reception, they danced together a few times but not enough to make anyone suspicious. The week after the newlyweds returned from their honeymoon, Arthur and Merlin showed up to the weekly pub night hand in hand with matching smiles on their faces. Their friends looked at them and broke into cheers before pulling them into hugs. -------- Six months later, Arthur was once again outside a dressing room standing in front of Merlin, tying a bow tie for him this time. He gave him a passionate kiss and then smoothed down Merlin&#x27;s shirt before he stepped back and looked him up and down. &quot;You look absolutely gorgeous,&quot; he told him. This time, Merlin was standing in front of him in the tuxedo he&#x27;d be wearing in less than a month to their own wedding. Arthur had never been happier. Merlin accepted his proposal after they were dating for less than five months and here they were, less than a month away from their wedding day. It had been a long bumpy road that Arthur had to travel down to regain Merlin&#x27;s trust but he&#x27;d finally made it to the end. Arthur knew what it was like to lose his precious Merlin, now that he had him once again, he was going to cherish and love him for the rest of his life. -------- Six years, one flat and one house later, Arthur and Merlin were in the park. Merlin was running around playing with their three-year-old daughter Freya and her new puppy. Arthur watched them from the picnic blanket they&#x27;d spread out under a tree and realized he was the luckiest man alive. Every morning, when he woke with Merlin in his arms, he couldn&#x27;t help but think that he almost lost this forever and he&#x27;d hold onto him a little bit longer and a little bit tighter. Then he&#x27;d think about his daughter and what he would&#x27;ve missed out on without Merlin&#x27;s forgiveness so he&#x27;d hold on just a little bit longer and a little bit tighter still. The end. Thanks for reading.</span> <a href="#" class="summary-toggle">[ + ]</a></div>

Or, Merlin thinks Arthur knows, and acts like it. Arthur is fine with the whole thing. Notes See the end of the work for notes It only happens when Merlin’s dragging. Only when they’ve all been run ragged– pushed to their limits and then past. Only when he can scarcely move one foot in front of the other, can’t even look in the direction of Arthur’s laundry. The first few times Arthur doesn’t even register it. His brain just files it away because Gold eyes? That isn’t something that happens. But one night he’s falling over himself into bed after a gruelling fight against a magical woodland creature he doesn’t even want to know the name of that they’re all painfully lucky to have escaped. Merlin mercifully ignores his shaking hands and Arthur looks the other way when Merlin’s face is damp after the thing is finally killed. And if Merlin’s hands are more tender that night as they unfasten his armor, Arthur chalks it up to the surprise of someone ill-acquainted with death. It had been a long ride back and his eyes were heavy long before the turrets of Camelot came into view. Laying there, collapsed on the sheets, Arthur has no idea how Merlin is still standing. He looks bone tired as he tries to drag Arthur’s boots off. Merlin’s putting his entire weight into pulling the boot when his fingers slip and he falls backward, landing on the floor with a loud thump. The boy chokes back a sob. Arthur wakes when Merlin stands again. He wonders how long it has been. Merlin looks determined now, as he grabs the boot again, and his eyes flash gold . The boot comes off and Merlin has the rest of his armor off and is gone before Arthur can really process anything. He’s asleep before he knows it. The next morning, however, it’s unmistakable. Sometimes Merlin’s eyes turn gold. It was really a very nice shade. It ought to have been unsettling but it was warm and inviting more than anything. He had asked around but no one seemed to know of gold eyes or even eyes occasionally changing color. And so, he assumed it was a Quirky Merlin Thing™. The thing about Merlin was that he was the most delightfully random human Arthur had the pleasure of knowing. He had a spectacular knowledge of herbs and Arthur found it embarrassingly enchanting o listen to him ramble about the medicinal value of birch bark. It was a Quirky Merlin Thing™. He constantly found the most ridiculous things to wear. Arthur asked him about the neck scarf one day, and Merlin had just stared at him with confusion as if it were the most common fashion trend in Camelot. Arthur gently pointed out that he had never met a single other human that wore one. Merlin didn’t seem to get the point. It was a Quirky Merlin Thing™. Sometimes he disappeared in the middle of the day without permission or apology. Quirky Merlin Thing™. He brought Arthur daisies one time. Quirky Merlin Thing™. He carved ducks into spare bits of wood when he was distracted. Quirky Merlin Thing™. He could walk on his hands, shockingly well. Quirky Merlin Thing™. He only ever drank lavender tea, despite complaining ardently that it tasted exactly like soap and making faces while consuming it. Quirky Merlin Thing™. Once, Arthur thought he saw him talk to a drape. And so, his brain helpfully filed Merlin’s gold eyes in this category and he moved happily on with his life. Except, the eyes fascinated him. He found himself staring sometimes, desperate to catch a glimpse again, to find out what he was missing, to watch the transformation and slip back to their normal dusty blue. He tried to figure out what caused them. Tiredness, he knew. But also empathy. It happened sometimes on Arthur’s birthday or the anniversary of his mother’s death when he couldn’t quite push the ache in his chest from his memory. It killed Merlin, Arthur knew, so most of the time he gave Merlin the day off or resorted to hiding. Merlin always found him. And sometimes, the eyes would happen. Late nights of travel had Arthur keeping Merlin later than he should have, eyes trained on the boy’s face. Long days saw the prince running through chambers to find his servant and keep him awake. Tournaments usually hit Arthur so hard that he couldn’t keep awake, but sometimes, when Arthur was particularly hurt, the eyes would glint sparks. – It had been a leisurely day. Arthur had given the knights the day off to spend with their families, preparing for Easter celebrations the next day. Merlin, of course, didn’t have any family to spend the day with as Gaius was tending to Morgana, particularly sick from a recent bout of nightmares. Absolutely nothing was happening. Merlin was polishing armor in the chair by the fireplace. Arthur was eating an apple. He had nothing better to do. “I’m bored.” Merlin sighs and looks at him resignedly. “You could help me polish.” Arthur stops chewing and stares at him for a moment. “‘M not that bored.” Merlin sighs again and resumes the movements of his cloth. The sun through the window lights up the floor around Merlin’s feet, basking his face in a sort of afterglow. His face is bright and his slender fingers appear to be magic as they flash in and out along the greaves. His brow is furrowed in concentration and Arthur smiles. He likes this Merlin, focused wholeheartedly on the task at hand, not distracted by things so far in his head that Arthur can’t get to him. He seems peaceful. He’s long since finished his apple. He also doesn’t know how long he’s been staring. “Merlin.” He says it softly, gently, unwilling to break the peaceful atmosphere in the room. Merlin looks up and fixes Arthur with that gentle smile, reserved only for him. Arthur licks his lips. “Do you know,” he says slowly, and he doesn’t know what makes him say it. He just wants Merlin to know that Arthur admires him and respects him. He just wants Merlin to smile, wants the tips of his ears to turn red, wants this soft, perfect moment to go on being soft and perfect for a little while longer and then maybe a little bit more. “Do you know that your eyes are beautiful when they glow gold?” It has the exact opposite of the intended effect. Merlin starts, and he starts badly, dropping the armor with a clang, which scares even him. His eyes are wide, terrified and then he’s running. He’s out of the room before Arthur can even call to him. Arthur is left faintly wondering what he did wrong, nursing a slight case of disappointment at the spoiled afternoon. – Gaius is not back and Merlin isn’t sure if he is happy or horrified at this. Fuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuck. “Okay Merlin, Arthur knows. It’s just Arthur, right? Just Arthur, the crown prince. Just the crown prince of Camelot who is currently involved in a nation-wide witch hunt who knows that you happen to be a sorcerer. That’s all. Just Arthur.” He heaves a book at the nearest bookshelf, not at all gratified when the ancient thing splinters. He does feel bad and feels his magic putting the thing to rights. These are Gauis’ chambers after all. Merlin clenches and unclenches his hands on the wooden table, dragging deep breaths in and out. It had been the eyes that had given him away in Ealdor too. Magic hadn’t been gone for as long; it had taken Uther and his band of terrors almost a decade to reach every outlying village. Almost everyone remembered what the golden eyes were of magic. For his friends and neighbors, they were things of beauty and hope, but after Uther also things of pain and suffering. And Arthur knew. Arthur fucking knew. – He lays low for a few days. The next day is easy because it’s a holiday and the castle is busy and he pleads sick the second day. But by the third day he’s sick with worry and even more sick with waiting, so he leaves the rooms before dawn and makes his way to Arthur’s chambers. He lights the fire, and pulls Arthur’s clothes for the day, before pulling the curtains open. He swivels only to find a very awake Arthur. “You’re up.” “Couldn’t sleep.” Merlin perches on the end of his bed, uncertain. “So.” Arthur just looks at him, eyelids heavy with resignation. “You know.” Arthur’s brow is drawn, his lips quirked. “I do.” Merlin licks his lips. “How long?” “I mean, I’ve suspected for months but it was just too preposterous and then I was it directly one night. I really will never understand you Merlin. It shouldn’t even be physically possible.” Merlin stares at him. It’s a longer speech than he’s used to getting from Arthur and he wants to make sure that he’s quite finished. “Is that it? Are you going to do anything?” Arthur cocks his head slightly. “Noo.” Merlin glances at the coverlet and backs up. “Thank you.” And then he’s somehow at Arthur’s side, dragging him out of bed, and pulling him into new clothes, and informing him of the busy day ahead. – Gaius hates it when he gets wind of the situation. “If he knows ,” Merlin argues, “then what does it matter if I do it around him?” “It’s the principle. You can’t get careless Merlin. This is life and death; even if it hasn’t ended disastrously this time, that means nothing for the next time.” Merlin hears the wisdom. He really does. And he tries to heed the older man, most of the time. – After The Eye Incident, his manservant just gets weirder– and more wonderful. For starters, Arthur gets to see the golden eyes far more often. Anytime Merlin cleans or sews or looks for something, his eyes flash and Arthur has to stop what he’s doing to watch. Secondly, the man is madly skilled. He does chores in a fraction of the time Arthur thinks they should take and is able to get stains out of shirts that the scullery maids have given up on, and once, when Arthur complains about the cold water Merlin somehow ensures it stays warm for the rest of his bath. And, in Arthur’s eyes, It’s Just Merlin. Because of course, he can do all of those things. – It’s been long years. Arthur is now king. Uther is gone. Morgana is no longer his. Arthur is alone. Well, not entirely alone Arthur’s lips quirk and Merlin and Gwen burst into the room, laughing to each other. The crown is heavy on his head and this spot of mirth is a rare sight in halls that prepare for a war few expect to survive. Arthur is secluded in his thoughts. A scream tears through the stillness of the room. The three of them run to the window, to find a crowd building in the courtyard. Then they’re running. Merlin is closer to Arthur’s sword, and he grabs it and passes it awkwardly off as they scramble down the dark hallways, shouting at servants to take cover. By the time they make it, Arthur’s knights have assembled, filling the quart yard uncertainly. The creator of the scream hangs seven feet off the ground, face disfigured and dress hanging tattered around her. Behind her, an army of equally disturbing figures stands, waiting for her command. Once Merlin and Arthur make it to the courtyard, (Arthur has long since learned that Merlin refuses to remain in safety.) the witch grins. “Merlin, Merlin, Merlin,” her voice is grating, “just the man I wanted to see.” She laughs shrilly and Arthur winces. He looks at his manservant, confused as to why the witch is so interested in him, though it seems that most of the creatures they fight have an odd fascination with his skinny (er, not now as skinny as he used to be) companion. The crone is speaking again and Arthur drags his attention to the present. “It seems that you have a choice to make.” Her gaze is piercing and Arthur shivers. Beside him, Merlin is stock still. “Either Camelot dies–” She waves her staff and a ball of fire rises from the tip, “or you die at the hands of your beloved king.” Her grin is wide, revealing horrible teeth. Merlin relaxes beside him, ever so slightly, but Arthur is confused. The only thing in the land that holds the death penalty is magic-wielding, a policy left in place from Uther’s reign. And then Merlin, beside him is moving. He looks at the dark-haired man, along with the rest of the knights in the field. They’re all standing stock-still, waiting to see what happens. “Well,” and Merlin, beautiful, blessed idiot that he is, actually grins “you’ve only made one mistake.” Arthur imagines that the witch’s own smile is faltering but he doesn’t dare take his eyes off of the perfect boy in front of him. The air is positively electric. Merlin looks wholly different. There’s something in his veins. He looks as if he could conquer the world. And then, Merlin takes a step. Onto thin air. Arthur stares. “I already have the support of the king of Camelot.” And then Merlin sprints the rest of the way up the nonexistent stairs, reaching long fingers into the sky, closing his eyes and pulling lightning from the clouds above. And Arthur realizes that this is exactly the way Merlin is supposed to look, powerful, strong, with the universe bending around his lithe frame, desperate to please him. Without a moment’s hesitation, Arthur utters the order to charge. His knights attack. Merlin attacks. – The battle was over shockingly fast. The lightning strikes from heaven definitely took the wind out of their sails, Arthur supposes. When Merlin comes down from the air and stands on the pavement again, Arthur grabs Leon’s arm and touches Merlin with it. Satisfied that the man isn’t shocked, Arthur grabs Merlin’s arm and hauls. They stand in Arthur’s room, the place they’ve had so many conversations, arguments, laughs, and even a few, unacknowledged tears. Arthur faces his. “Merlin.” “Arthur.” “That’s all you’ve got?” “Look, I know it wasn’t ideal, but honestly what are you even doing with the magic ban? You obviously don’t believe in it or I would have been in the stocks years ago–” Arthur holds up a finger to stop him. He drags in a deep breath. “Years ago?” Wide-eyed, Merlin nods slowly. “Merlin, how on earth are you figuring that I somehow knew this before today?” Merlin blinks. “You– you didn’t know?” “No, you twat, I didn’t know. Why do you think I did?” Merlin is dumbfounded. “The– my– my eyes,” he’s stammering. “What about them?” “They turn gold.” “Yes, I know that.” A distinctly uncomfortable feeling is curling in the bottom of Arthur’s stomach. He’s cheeks flush slightly at the memory. “Arthur, the eyes of sorcerors turn gold when they practice magic.” It doesn’t even hit him for all of four seconds. When it does, his jaw drops. “I– you– all that time? And you– and I–” He lapses into stunned silence. They stand there for a long time, Arthur growing more and more dazed. Finally, “How was I supposed to know that yellow eyes meant magic? My father forbade anyone of ever speaking about it in my presence.” Merlin chuckles quietly. “I guess I hadn’t thought about that.” “So all this time, you thought I knew.” Merlin nods softly. And then Arthur’s head is snapping up again. “Hang on, this is the first time I’ve seen you practice magic, and yet your eyes are gold every day.” Merlin tilts his head. “Arthur, I’ve been practicing magic in front of you for years.” Arthur shakes his head fervently. “I think I would have noticed.” And then Merlin takes one of Arthur’s calloused hands into his, gently. “Arthur.” And Arthur feels his December-air cold hands begin to warm deliciously, from something that was distinctly not Merlin’s even colder fingers, nor his own body. “This is magic.” The fire behind the boy reaches higher up the wall. “That is magic.” Merlin whispers it against Arthur’s cheek. Beside them, the curtains ruffle slightly. “Magic.” Arthur can feel Merlin’s breath on his cheek. A buckle on his armor comes undone. Merlin doesn’t even say anything, just stands there, clinging to Arthur’s hand, cheek resting against Arthur’s chest plate. Around him, the room is alive. Flowers grow delicately along his mantle, and armor polishes itself. The laundry is being folded by an unseen hand and remaining wrinkles are shaken out of his bed. Arthur feels like he’s being caressed all over. Magic cards through his hair and presses into aching muscles. And suddenly Arthur understands. This magic is like nothing he ever dreamed. He thought it was powerful and bad and made a ruckus, but the way Merlin has been using it, for years is just– Merlin. The tiny comforts and beautiful things about life that Merlin made that way. They weren’t evil, they weren’t even big. They were just Merlin Things. Arthur draws in a deep breath, dangerously close to a cry. Merlin stays where he is. – It’s been two hours. Merlin has been showing Arthur everything he wants to see. He makes a tiny dragon out of magic, and Arthur is mesmerized as it lazily flaps its wings, gliding in circles around the golden head. Merlin smiles up at Arthur, seated in a dining chair. He suddenly has a thought. “Arthur you didn’t know .” Arthur, somewhat begrudgingly, looks away from the dragon toward Merlin before immediately snapping his gaze back. “No yeah, that’s pretty much the whole point.” “You didn’t know and you still ordered the entire Camelot army to back me up.” This time Arthur actually pins his gaze on Merlin. He hasn’t really had time to think about that. “Yeah. I guess I did.” They stare at each other. Arthur is the one to break the silence. “Look, Merlin, it’s you. Magic or no, I trust you, completely. That wasn’t the time for debate, that was the time for trust.” Tears well in Merlin’s eyes and before Arthur knows what’s happening the black-haired bundle is launching itself into his arms with far too much force and their chair is tipping backward and Arthur’s braces for the fall that never comes. When he opens his eyes, they’re levitating a few inches off the ground, Merlin’s arms wrapped around him. Gingerly, he snakes his arms around the boy’s waist. “Merlin, I’ll always choose you.” And the way Merlin nestles perfectly there in his arms, well, that&#x27;s just a Quirky Merlin Thing™.

But when, in the face of death, time shrinks dramatically and frail strength doesn&#x27;t allow you to calm the trembling of the arms around you, it&#x27;s better to express too little than nothing. - A collection of loosely connected stories focusing on Arthur and Merlin, intended to deepen the canon. I&#x27;m moving all the stories in &quot;The gold coin&quot; series here! Their updates will appear here. Notes Hello! I&#x27;ve decided to order my &#x27;The gold coin&#x27; series and put all the stories in one place. I will gradually move them here, and their updates, and news will appear here. For those who haven&#x27;t dealt with my work before, I warn you that English isn&#x27;t my strong point, so stupid mistakes may appear. Nevertheless, I hope you&#x27;ll enjoy. Out of love &quot;I believe that this cliché-sounding theory about the power of maternal love should not be underestimated. It may indeed be that Ygraine Pendragon&#x27;s wish for her son to be protected after her death was so powerful that it took human form&quot;. Elanor Wright &quot;The Shadow of the Great King&quot; Out of love Ygraine took off her shoe and touched the pleasantly damp grass with her bare foot. After a moment, she dropped the other one as well and took a few deep breaths. The touch of dew on her skin and the crisp air dampened a little the anxiety that had been tormenting her, which had been growing in her day by day until it had finally begun to overwhelm her to the point where she was unable to function normally. She didn’t mention this to Uther, or even to Gaius. They wouldn&#x27;t understand. They would have thought she was frightened by her pregnancy, that she needs medicine to calm her down. She didn&#x27;t need any medicine. It would only stun her and take away her ability to act, and Ygraine had to do something while she still had time. She knew that the price of her child&#x27;s birth would be her life; not that of some thug, a villain, a random, anonymous person, as Uther wanted to believe, but her own. She grasped this as soon as she felt she was pregnant. A mother&#x27;s life for her son&#x27;s life. It was then that an intrusive voice appeared in her head, a hissing whisper, slipping into her thoughts and poisoning them with its venom. Take some concoction and be done with it. Get rid of this parasite from your body, this monster created against nature that sucks the last breath out of you. She fought a fierce battle with this voice. In her mind, she mercilessly chopped it down with her sword and trampled it into the ground, because she loved her unborn son with her whole being. The strength of this feeling surprised her. She had never been able to imagine motherhood before, and mothers&#x27; declarations that they would do anything for their children sounded to her like just another empty platitude not to be repeated. She wanted to have a child, for her husband, for the kingdom, but not necessarily for her own sake. However, when he appeared under her heart, he unexpectedly warmed her from the inside out, almost melting her insides, it shone like the most precious treasure. And she was going to defend this treasure with all her might. Not for her husband, not for the kingdom, not for herself, but for him, so that he could live, love and be loved as she was now. She talked a lot, sang and played the lute, hoping that her boy... Arthur couldn’t hear that hideous voice. Especially the words about the parasite and the monster. Everyone thought she was in a good mood. Uther looked at her with a tender smile, grasped her hands, showered her with kisses and asked for more songs. She knew a lot of them. She wondered if her son would know them, if he would like them? She looked up into the still dark sky. There was some time left until dawn, maybe an hour. She would have time to return before Uther awoke and became alarmed by her absence. She had gone out into the garden after a particularly awful nightmare in which someone had thrown her newborn into a pit full of snakes, and she could do nothing about it. Unable to move the slightest muscle, she was stuck suspended in space, silent and unnoticed by anyone, like a... ghost. This nightmare was recurring and Ygraine was convinced that there was some symbolism in it, a warning addressed to her. There was also another dream that took her over with particular horror. Three tall, hooded figures, standing over a tank of black water, speaking in one voice about the sentence that had been passed on her son. As they finished speaking, they would dissipate into the mist, and a thunderous laughter, the frantic retching of some powerful being, would reach her. Perhaps it was the same being that tried to plant vile thoughts in her mind, called Arthur a parasite and a monster, wanted to get rid of him before he even came into the world. Today, sitting on a stone bench, in a garden she was never to see again in full bloom, Ygraine decided that she could no longer ignore what appeared to be an extra maternal sense that, since she would not be here to guard Arthur&#x27;s every step, she must provide the best possible protection for him. She had no magical abilities, but Gaius had mentioned that there were types of magic where only the power of intention mattered, that for some spells no special talent and years of practice were needed at all. From the pocket of her cloak, she took out her sigil. She clenched it in her hand, as she always did when she wanted to concentrate. Then she stood barefoot on the dew-wet grass. She didn&#x27;t know any ritual, but her heart told her that she didn&#x27;t need any. She raised her hand with the sigil, to the sky, to the twinkling stars, drew air into her lungs, silenced the whispering angry voice with her imaginary sword, pushed all fears, all unnecessary thoughts out of her mind, leaving only what was her purpose. „May Arthur be safe on his journey”, she said quietly. „May someone appear by his side who will love and guard him, as I love and as I would guard. May he be surrounded by true love and people with the sincerest hearts. May all misfortunes pass him by, and may those that cannot pass him by make him stronger and better. May he be happy and may he bring happiness to the world”. Energy, coming as if from within the earth, surged through her, from her toes to the fingers of her hands clenched into a sigil that was warm and pulsed gently. Ygraine noticed with amazement that a thin trickle of blue light flowed from between her fingers. She was overwhelmed with euphoria. She repeated her words louder, more confidently, more powerfully. The sigil burned, but it didn’t scald her skin. A trickle of light transformed into a flame. Ygraine, fascinated, brought it to her face. It was so beautiful that it hurt. She didn&#x27;t want it to disappear. This time she whispered her words directly to it, softly, as if in the ear of a loved one. Tears of happiness ran down her cheeks. The flame turned into a huge ball, which remained on her hand for a moment longer, before rising above the treetops and sailing slowly through the darkness, in a direction it only knew. When it had become barely a tiny dot, Ygraine sank back onto the bench. She was still clutching the sigil, not wanting to part with it. She had no idea what she had just done, but she felt with every, tiniest nerve that something great had happened. She had made it happen: Ygraine, Arthur&#x27;s mother. The voice can whisper to itself, maybe even roar with laughter. She is more powerful. She applied the sigil to her rounded belly. A mother&#x27;s life, for her son&#x27;s life. Arthur will be blood from her blood, bone from her bone, soul from her soul. He will be special. The thought of parting with her life evoked a nauseating fear, , , but Ygraine would probably have chosen to do so even in full knowledge of the price. Or maybe she was fully aware of the price from the beginning? Perhaps she had made the decision herself in her heart? The kingdom needs an heir to the throne, and just as men sacrifice themselves on the battlefields, so too must she not shirk her duty. She put the sigil in her pocket and set off towards the castle. It must be ensured that Arthur gets it. Later today she will talk with Gaius, who, after all, as a physician, is aware that anything can happen during childbirth and will not be surprised by the request. She wasn&#x27;t going to sully Uther&#x27;s happiness, since these were to be their last months together. She would make the most of this time, give him as much as she could, and then... And then he would have a son. Four years later, when, thanks to Uther, things were happening in Camelot that Ygraine had never dreamt of in her worst nightmares, in a small village in a neighbouring kingdom, a midwife handed a tiny boy to a woman exhausted by childbirth. „It would be better for you if that bastard didn&#x27;t start breathing”, she said, looking at her with undisguised contempt. „His name is Merlin”, the young mother replied. „And don&#x27;t you dare call him anything else”. It was supposed to be proof Chapter Summary Merlin has a rather unpleasant morning and then gets a strange command.

My father.&quot; Merlin nodded in understanding and the two slipped into the dark. Minutes later Merlin was pressed back against the stone wall, hips held down by Arthur&#x27;s hand. The blonde boy nipped gently at Merlin&#x27;s neck, murmuring into his ear. &quot;Missed you.&quot; Merlin sighed into the touch of Arthur&#x27;s lips, and the blonde brought his head up, bringing his lips to Merlin&#x27;s. The two pressed together, Merlin tugging his lover close. Several minutes later, the two broke apart, chests heaving and lips swollen. Merlin grinned up at Arthur, who returned the look. Arthur took Merlin by the hand and the two slipped quietly up to Merlin&#x27;s room. As soon as the door shut Arthur was pulling Merlin close again, seeking any touch. The blonde pushed Merlin back slightly, falling onto the bed. Merlin laughed, then clapped a hand over his mouth, his eyes twinkling. Arthur snorted, but the two quickly became involved in each other&#x27;s touch once again. Arthur lay on top of Merlin, cradling the dark haired boy&#x27;s face in his hand, and kissing the life out of him. Merlin wrapped his arms around Arthur, pulling him closer. Arthur slid one hand away from Merlin&#x27;s face, and slowly slid it under the fabric of Merlin&#x27;s shirt, his hand resting on Merlin&#x27;s stomach, a gentle warmth. Arthur&#x27;s lips traveled down Merlin&#x27;s neck, the smaller boy moaning quietly and the sensation. Arthur rested his other hand on Merlin&#x27;s chest, and then whispered out a rough, &quot;Off.&quot; Merlin sat up, tugging the shirt over his shoulders, before laying back down, a blush spreading down his neck to his chest. Arthur smirked at him, then re-connected their lips briefly, his mouth traveling slowly across Merlin&#x27;s torso, teasing his nipples gently, slowly, before traveling down further. He teased Merlin a bit, tracing patterns across Merlin&#x27;s stomach, knowing he was ticklish. &quot;Arthur!&quot; Merlin hissed, his stomach tensing in protest. Merlin shoved at Arthur&#x27;s head lightly, teasingly, but Arthur got off Merlin entirely. &quot;Oh, you want me off then?&quot; He smirked, and Merlin groaned. &quot;No, I don&#x27;t.&quot; &quot;You sure? You really seemed like you didn&#x27;t there.&quot; His tone was teasing, and Merlin replied with, &quot;I don&#x27;t want you tickling me, but I want you...there...&quot; &quot;Where?&quot; &quot;/There/. Arthur, you know what I mean!&quot; &quot;I wanna hear you say it.&quot; Arthur said, murmuring into his ear, as he lowered his body back down onto Merlin&#x27;s. Merlin rolled his eyes, but muttered out, &quot;I want you on my cock.&quot; Arthur laughed, low in his throat. &quot;Perfect.&quot; The blonde slid back down to Merlin&#x27;s stomach, and after pressing a kiss to his belly button and getting a threatening glare from Merlin he went lower. Arthur grabbed at Merlin&#x27;s trousers, sliding them off his legs. His head went down, and Merlin&#x27;s back arched. ------- Sometime later Arthur lay on Merlins chest, both boys sweaty, their bare skin rosy from their activities. They lay in silence, snuggled into each other, their legs entwined, candlelight flickering on them. Merlin slid his hand onto Arthur&#x27;s cheek, tilting the blonde&#x27;s head so their eyes met. &quot;Hmm?&quot; Arthur mumbled sleepily. &quot;I love you.&quot; Arthur smiled, his eyes close to shutting. &quot;Love you too Mer.&quot; Suddenly, the door opened, showing the shocked face of Gaius. &quot;Excuse me?!&quot; The two jumped, Merlin trying to stutter out an excuse. &quot;Um, uh, I was jus- I mean, we were just-&quot; Arthur interuppted. &quot;We were just hot.&quot; Merlin glared at him when Gaius glanced away, to which Arthur raised his eyebrows, with an expression saying, &#x27;what else could I say.&#x27; &quot;You were hot then.&quot; Gaius said, clearly unbelieving, &quot;Why were you here in the first place then your Majesty? In Merlin&#x27;s bed of all places.&quot; &quot;Well, um,&quot; Now it was Arthur&#x27;s turn to sputter. &quot;He had a disagreement with his father, and needed some place to cool off. We got tired.&quot; Merlin offered. Gaius raised an eyebrow, and then sighed. &quot;I&#x27;m sure you could return to your room without confrontation from your father now my lord.&quot; &quot;Certainly.&quot; Arthur glanced at the door, knowing he was still undressed. &quot;I&#x27;ll leave in a moment.&quot; Arthur nodded at Gaius, who sighed and left the room, but not before giving Merlin a Look. As soon as the door shut, Arthur scrambled for his clothes, as did Merlin. &quot;Hey,&quot; Arthur said, catching sight of Merlin&#x27;s fearful face. &quot;We&#x27;ll be okay. I can see to that.&quot; Merlin nodded, and Arthur brushed his cheek softly with his hand, then leaned in for a quick, very quick kiss. The two went downstairs, and after bidding Gaius goodnight, Arthur was on his way. Merlin avoided the old man&#x27;s eyes, and tried to walk quietly to his room, but Gaius stopped him. &quot;So. Are you going to explain?&quot; &quot;I thought we already had.&quot; Gaius sighed, and sat down. &quot;Merlin. I&#x27;m not stupid. Besides the fact that both of your clothes were strewn about the floor and your bodies are both strewn with kissbruises, you are both terrible, terrible, liars.&quot; Merlin let out a gust of air, and sat down, his face in his hand. After a moment he raised his head, meeting Gaius&#x27;s eyes. &quot;I&#x27;m sorry.&quot; &quot;Do you love him?&quot; &quot;What?&quot; &quot;I asked you if you love him. Do you?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; Merlin whispered, eyes on the floor now. &quot;And he you?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;How long?&quot; &quot;Less than a year. Eight months, in two weeks.&quot; &quot;Well. Invite him here tommorow, I just talk with him.&quot; Merlin looked up, wary. &quot;Why?&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m your guardian, I have to approve of him. He may be the kings son, but that doesn&#x27;t mean he gets to hurt my ward.&quot; Gaius looked down at Merlin kindly, whose face clearly showed his shock. &quot;You aren&#x27;t going to kick me out? Or report us?&quot; &quot;No, I&#x27;m not Merlin. I care for you, if Arthur is who makes you happy then so be it. Doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m going to go easy on him tommorow though.&quot; He said with a wink. &quot;Thank you.&quot; Merlin said, still somewhat dazed. &quot;Of course.&quot;</span> <a href="#" class="summary-toggle">[ + ]</a></div>

Merthur one-shot really short “Ugh. Merlin c’mon, stop pouting it was just a movie” Arthur said to his best friend. “No, I have a right to ‘pout’ seeing as you went to see the new avengers movie without me” the raven-haired teen said to his best friend. “Come on please, I hate it when you sulk and not talk to me, I apologized like fifty times and I even bought more tickets for tonight at seven” Arthur whined, he stuck out his bottom lip. He sounded like a puppy. Merlin’s knees threatened to buckle. “Arthur stop, that’s not gonna work tonight” Melin demanded. The raven-haired teen moved to the couch. “Did you actually get more tickets?” Arthur nodded, “I did” “You didn’t have to do that, spend your money on me I mean” Merlin said. Arthur shook his head this time “I didn’t, I used your card” “ I never should’ve given you my code” Merlin growled. “Are you still mad” the blond asked. “Yes!” merlin said exasperated, he crossed his arms across his chest. It was Arthur’s turn to adopt a moue look. “Sorry” Arthur was beginning to worry, Merlin never stayed mad at him this long. Then he remembered. Arthur grinned mischievously at Merlin. “What, what’s that face for…” Merlin’s eyes widened “no.. don’t you dare!” Arthur launched himself across the couch and onto Merlin. The blonds hands quickly found Merlin’s curved sides and he wiggled his fingers brushing the ticklish skin. Merlin pursed his lips determined to keep his laughter in. When Arthur didn’t get much of a reaction he moved his hands to his best friends underarms then back to his sides quickly. Merlin couldn’t help it if he held in his laughter any longer he was sure he’d combust. He opened his mouth and his melodic laugh filled the room. Arthur also began to laugh his atrociously adorable laugh. As he tried to keep it down his laugh turned to giggles while Merlin laughed hysterically. “Arthur… pl-please, please s-stop” Merlin giggled out. “What?” “I’m… sorry-i’m not … mad I..I promise” Merlin gasped. “Are you sure” “Y-yes” “Okay” Arthur dropped his hands. The two teens were lying one on top of the other, sweaty and messy on the couch. As Arthur’s breath came out in puffs blowing Merlin’s ‘too lazy to cut’ long bangs out of the way they stared into one another&#x27;s eyes. Blue meeting a lighter blue. At that moment Arthur realised how much he had been aching to to taste those luscious tempting lips for forever. The blond leaned down and Merlin’s eyes widened. The space between them decreased at an annoyingly slow pace. After what seemed like forever Merlin moved up and pressed his lips to the blond. He felt Arthur’s lips part as he gasped merlin took advantage and slid his tongue in. After what seemed like forever Merlin moaned and they broke apart. “We should probably get going so we don’t miss the movie” “Yah, okay” they got off the couch and straightened their clothes as best as they could. As they exited Merlin’s house Arthur followed him to the passenger’s seat and opened the door. Merlin got in and before he shut the door Arthur leaned down and gave merlin a quick peck on the lips, Merlin sighed. Arthur never opened the doors for merlin like he had just did but Merlin didn’t care cause it felt good. It felt right</span> <a href="#" class="summary-toggle">[ + ]</a></div>
